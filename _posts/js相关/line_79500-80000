We have no reason to shrink from these challenges.
Even under the pressures of a globalized world, democratic systems that champion the rule of law are more resilient than the illiberal regimes that many – including some in Europe – are praising nowadays.
But this does not mean that we can defuse any crisis by means of preventive action or clever intervention.
Now more than ever, understanding the limits of one's capabilities is an essential part of a viable foreign policy.
This does not mean embracing moral relativism.
Our foreign policy must retain its hopefulness and ability to act responsibly.
Yet holding firm to our moral precepts must go hand in hand with a realistic assessment of constraints.
Germany's global inter-connectedness, which has long been vital for our prosperity and security, does not allow us to pretend that we are either an island or a world historical force.
Within any effective peace strategy for the twenty-first century, foreign policy must simultaneously focus on crisis prevention and diplomacy, and bolster efforts that support transformation.
For Germany, all of these objectives must be pursued within the framework of a strong and integrated European Union in which we assume our leadership responsibilities for global peace and prosperity.
Germany has much to offer to the world, and we will do so with self-confidence and humility.
The Limits of German Guilt
MUNICH – This month marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Germany and Israel.
The bilateral relationship, born in the wake of the Nazis’ annihilation of European Jewry, has developed into a solid one.
But fading memories of the Holocaust among younger Germans, together with Israel’s declining international standing, have lately challenged the official discourse about “special” ties between the two countries.
David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s founding father and the architect of Israel’s reconciliation with Germany, was a pragmatist through and through.
He knew that forging a partnership with Germany, which included reparations that would help boost Israel’s capabilities, could go a long way toward securing Israel’s survival.
Of course, the reparations – which began in 1952 – served Germany’s interests, too.
The best way to regain international legitimacy after World War II was to atone publicly for the atrocities committed by the Nazis, and reconcile with the world’s Jewish population.
But the case for establishing full diplomatic relations was not so clear.
Fearing that such a move would undermine its relationships with Arab countries, and thus its objective of maintaining an impartial Middle East policy, Chancellor Ludwig Erhard’s government resisted Israeli pressure to establish full ties until 1965.
Even then, German policy in the Middle East continued to reflect a domestic consensus that Germany’s responsibility for Israel’s security must be balanced with an effort to remain neutral in the region’s affairs.
Still, over the last half-century, the bilateral relationship has become a formidable one.
Germany is Israel’s largest trading partner in Europe, and its third-largest overall, after the United States and China.
Moreover, Germany has been among Israel’s most reliable allies, exemplified by its role as a major arms supplier.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has emerged as a staunch defender of the country, exemplified in a 2008 address to the Knesset (Israel’s parliament), in which she identified Israel’s security as an essential feature of Germany’s Staatsraison.
But Germany also appears to be increasingly uneasy about having to continue supporting Israel even when its policies are clearly reproachable.
Seventy years after the liberation of Auschwitz, can the bilateral relationship withstand the rising tide of anti-Israel sentiment in Europe?
History has its ironies.
Post-war Germany could regain international legitimacy only through reconciliation with the Jewish people.
Today, it is Israel’s legitimacy that is being challenged in international institutions and Western public opinion for its mistreatment of the Palestinians.
The role reversal has been remarkable.
Both Jews and Germans emerged from WWII as defeated and crippled peoples, but the Jews had the moral high ground, while the Germans very much did not.
Yet, in a global opinion poll conducted in 2013 by the BBC World Service, Israel ranked as one of the least popular countries – just above North Korea, Pakistan, and Iran – whereas Germany emerged as the most popular.
But the extent of this inversion is best exemplified in the increasing prevalence of obscene comparisons between Israel’s policies toward Palestine and the Nazis’ treatment of the Jews.
A study conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation in January showed that 35% of Germans have no problem making that connection.
In what might presage a shift in the bilateral relationship, the poll also revealed that 58% of Germans believe that the past should be consigned to history, and 62% disapprove of Israel’s policies today.
Of course, Germany’s eagerness to discharge the burden of history is not new.
Back in 1998, the renowned intellectual Martin Walser publicly attacked the pervasiveness of Auschwitz in Germany’s remembrance culture, declaring that the Holocaust had become a “moral cudgel” with which to intimidate all Germans and keep them “in a perpetual state of guilt.”
Walser’s stance amounted to a desperate call to allow his country to shape a new national identity – one that reflected its resolute repudiation of fascism and adoption of democracy, rather than its highly regrettable (and regretted) history.
And it drew a standing ovation from all but one of the 1,200 illustrious members of the audience in Frankfurt’s Pauluskirche, where Walser was being awarded the German Booksellers Association Peace Prize.
The lone exception was Ignatz Bubis, the head of Germany’s Jewish community.
As Israel’s policies have become increasingly indefensible, the Germans’ will to shape national policy independent of Holocaust guilt has grown even stronger.
The poem “What Must Be Said,” written in 2012 by the late Nobel laureate Günter Grass, may be frivolous and cliché-laden, but it is no less revealing of the growing fatigue of German society with the paralyzing memory of the Holocaust.
Not only did Grass define Israel as “a threat to world peace”; he also noted that he had remained silent for so long simply because he believed that his own origins, “tarnished by a stain that can never be removed,” denied him the right to speak the truth.
Like Grass, Germans – especially the younger generations, who feel further removed from the events of WWII – are increasingly abandoning the notion that they owe it to Israel to remain its silent, steadfast supporters.
Indeed, as Israel’s right-wing government moves to bury the two-state solution for good, Germans are joining other Europeans in vocally opposing Israeli policy in Palestine.
Simply put, historic guilt is no longer adequate to compel Germany to support Israel’s wrongheaded policies – especially when those policies are victimizing another group, the Palestinians.
Israel’s current leaders should take note.
German Reunification and the New Europe
PARIS – I began writing this column shortly after a remarkable anniversary. October 3, 1990, was the effective date for the implementation of a stunning decision taken barely a month earlier.
On August 23, East Germany’s House of Representatives, the Volkskammer, voted for unilateral adherence by the East German Länder to West Germany’s Constitution.
Article 23 of the West German Basic Law permitted this, but neither West Germany’s government nor its Parliament had been consulted!
Reunification terms were subsequently defined in a Treaty signed in Berlin on August 31, 1990, and ratified by both the East and West German parliaments on September 20.
The Peace Treaty between the two German states and the four victorious Allies was signed in Moscow on the same day, and reunification was officially proclaimed on October 3.
These events, accomplished by three actors, shook the world – and changed it forever.
The first actor was Mikhail Gorbachev, who approved the act – the opening of the border between Austria and Hungary – that triggered the chain of events leading to reunification.
And it was Gorbachev who proclaimed that Soviet forces would not intervene to support troubled communist regimes against the will of their people – a declaration aimed directly at East Germany.
The second key figure was West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who rushed into the opened breach, overriding his Allies’ caution, while the third actor was the East German people, who rushed into the streets, regardless of the risks, to demonstrate and push reunification forward.
These events had a profound impact on relations between Germany and its allies.
The United States, Great Britain, and France all seemed to think that everything was happening too fast, that international security was at risk should the new Germany not confirm its membership in NATO (which Germany finally did).
But for a few months, there were fears that Russia would demand Germany’s withdrawal from the Alliance as a condition of its agreement to reunification.
While the US masked its doubts, Great Britain and France were less at ease.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher limited herself to worried public statements, but French President François Mitterrand felt it necessary to improvise a visit to East Berlin, against the opinion of his Foreign Ministry and despite the French people’s great enthusiasm for German reunification. Mitterrand hoped to slow the process and to link negotiations to some international guarantees.
His effort was a fiasco, remembered in Berlin to this day.
The motive of Mitterrand’s “mission” was to determine what precautions could or should be taken against the potential vagaries of this powerful but unpredictable people.
The response was eventually enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, which extended the European Union’s competences to foreign affairs and judicial matters, making them partly supranational.
Great Britain and Denmark, however, insisted that these new competences be exercised on intergovernmental grounds only, not by the European Commission, and thus only through consensus.
France did not vote, so Great Britain and Denmark won by default.
Europe would take common action related to foreign affairs only on unanimous grounds.
Political Europe was stillborn at the moment of greatest potential.
This was a major disappointment for Germany, particularly as it could no longer count on France, its main ally in Europe.
In Germany itself, failure to achieve a politically integrated federal Europe baffled pro-integration political forces and dented the war generation’s moral authority.
The New Germany and its post-war generation felt tempted to recover a reunified, yet lonely, German identity, one with influence in Europe and worldwide.
As a result, reunified Germany naturally fell back on its old sphere of dominance, Eastern Europe.
But Germany’s leaders were uneasy with these changes.
In September 1994, two MPs from the majority Christian Democratic Union published a political statement on Europe, questioning its future, particularly the prospect of federalism.
A dismal silence greeted its publication, which left Germany’s pro-European establishment isolated and dispirited.
Indeed, in May 2000, Joschka Fischer, the ex-leader of the Green Party and German Foreign Minister, gave a long speech about the necessity of European integration. The question about European federalism was posed to all member states, and none answered.
France, obviously in the limelight, remained silent, again leaving Germany to feel abandoned by its partners.
A process of erosion, catalyzed by British diplomacy, was under way. It succeeded.
The prospect of genuine European integration on foreign affairs and defense issues was denied time and again, at each step of the successive negotiations for the Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice, the aborted constitutional project, and Lisbon.
Time passed, generations changed.
In today’s Germany, because no one with decisive power in business, finance, or government experienced the war, the European project is no longer viewed as conditioning Europe’s collective future.
These new leaders envision Europe only as a trade regime.
Meanwhile, German diplomacy is actively reconstructing the country’s economic and cultural spheres of influence, and not only in Eastern Europe.
The impact of this lost European perspective became clear in the autumn of 2008 when, in the aftermath of the sub-prime crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s first impulse was nationalistic and wholly anti-European.
There would be no common European plan to address the crisis, and no call for public funds. Germany would protect its banks’depositors on its own and through private means.
Only the sheer gravity of the situation brought Germany back within the European realm for the subsequent G-20 meeting.
Twenty years after reunification was completed, Germany has become one of the world’s great democracies.
Many wish that it were also more European in its outlook and behavior.
But Germany does not bear the main responsibility for killing off the vision of political Europe.
Germany is Not Volkswagen
MUNICH – The Volkswagen scandal has raised questions about the German model of production.
If the success of the company’s diesel-powered vehicles was due in part to fraudulent efforts to conceal the amount of harmful pollutants they emitted, will similar revelations at other companies call into questions the country’s transformation from “the sick man of Europe” to an export-driven economic powerhouse?
Fortunately, the answer is almost certainly no.
Germany’s competitive advantage has less to do with chicanery than with how its firms are structured and the culture in which they operate.
Germany’s leading car company is an exception to the manufacturing rules that have driven the country’s success, not an example of them.
Indeed, Germany’s success is frequently cited as a model that other countries should emulate, and rightly so.
Since the beginning of the century, the country has grown to become one of the world’s leading exporters, outstripping all other major European countries.
From 2000 to 2013, Germany’s exports grew by 154%, compared to 127% for Spain, 98% for the United Kingdom, 79% for France, and 72% for Italy.
The leading explanation for Germany’s impressive recent export performance is wage restraint.
But, as a comparison with Spain reveals, faster wage growth elsewhere cannot be the entire story.
To be sure, from 2000 to 2008, German wages increased by 19%, compared to 48% in Spain.
But after the 2009 financial crisis, the roles were reversed.
From 2009 to 2013, German nominal wages increased by more than 14%, compared to 4% in Spain.
And yet, despite the more rapid rise in German wages, the country’s exports rebounded faster than Spain’s – or those of any other European Union country.
The most important factor behind Germany’s success is that the structure of its firms improves the quality of their products.
German exporters are organized in a way that is less hierarchical and more decentralized than other European firms.
This gives them several advantages.
Decentralization enables employees at lower levels of the corporate hierarchy to devise and implement new ideas.
As these employees are often closer to customers than those higher up, their collective knowledge about what the market is demanding is an important source of value.
Tapping this knowledge allows Germany to compete on quality, not price.
Indeed, if wage restraint were the main factor in Germany’s success, it would be hard pressed to outperform French, Italian, British, and Spanish exporters, who compete mainly on price by offshoring production to low-wage countries.
Instead, the German focus on quality allows its firms to charge higher prices and gain new customers.
When exporters are asked to rank their products relative to a market average, 40% of German exporters classify their goods as top quality, while only 10% of French exporters do so.
Decentralized management has helped German exporters triple their share of the global market for top-quality goods compared to those firms that did not reorganize.
Indeed, when I studied the top 1% of German exporters – the country’s export superstars – I found that they more than doubled their share of the world export market when they opted to decentralize their organizations.
This focus on quality could explain why German exports rebounded quickly after 2009, despite the rise in nominal wages.
Quality makes exporters less vulnerable to changes in price – including those driven by rising wages.
By contrast, those countries in which firms compete on price may have felt more pressure to move production abroad as domestic wages rose.
Germany’s relative insensitivity to rising costs could also explain why its government is comfortable with a strong euro, whereas France and Italy have been calling on the European Central Bank to weaken the currency.
Volkswagen, it turns out, took a different approach from that of most other German firms.
Rather than decentralizing power, CEO Martin Winterkorn sat at the head of a centralized, command-and-control organization in which he acted as a patriarch.
His desire to take the company to the very top of the global car industry, surpassing Toyota, put enormous strain on his managers to deliver growth.
The result – a decision to cheat on emissions tests – says less about Germany’s culture of manufacturing than about rot at the car company, beginning at the very top.
According to the World Value Survey, Germany is a high-trust society, in which citizens have confidence in one another’s behavior and act accordingly.
Indeed, the lesson of the Volkswagen scandal is that this culture may be necessary for its export model to work.
French and Italian exporters that introduced decentralized management did not increase their share of the global market for top-quality goods. The likely reason is that providing division managers with greater autonomy not only frees them up to respond to market demands; it also allows them to put their own career interests above the wellbeing of the firm.
If Germany is to maintain its economic dominance, it will have to do something far harder than keeping wages in check or restructuring hierarchies.
It will have to ensure that the culture of integrity underlying its success remains unchanged by the pressures of global competition.
The Visible Hand of Economic Prosperity
FRANKFURT – Germany has weathered the financial crisis much better than most of its neighbors.
Regarded as the sick man of Europe as recently as 1999, today the country boasts the continent's strongest economy, accounting for roughly a quarter of its exports.
Its unemployment rate, at just below 5%, is half the European average.
The federal budget is balanced for the first time in a decade.
But it would be a mistake to assume that Germany's economic performance vindicates its policymaking.
In fact, Germany's current economic dominance has been built on a policy framework that stands in direct opposition to that championed by former Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, the father of its post-World War II “economic miracle."
In lieu of Erhard's so-called ordoliberalism – in which the state lays the groundwork for a functioning market economy by actively managing the legal environment – the economic strategy pursued by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been haphazard, driven more by political expediency than by any underlying philosophy.
Germany would be wise not to take its economic success for granted.
In a time of increasing economic and political uncertainty, Erhard's guiding principles are more important than ever.
Indeed, Germany's policymakers seem to be stumbling from decision to decision.
Instead of steering the economy, they are being driven by it, reacting with no clear sense of direction to the demands of the moment.
The country's celebrated de-carbonization is putting its industry at risk.
Collective bargaining, once left to economic actors, is becoming increasingly politicized.
Changes in pension policy are boosting public spending and contributing to rising levels of debt.
At the heart of Germany's troubles is the stubborn – and internationally widespread – idea that the economy is a large, clock-like mechanism into which the state can intervene without consequences.
The increasing mathematization of economics in recent decades has abetted this development.
The central weakness of democratic systems also contributes to the problem: The quest for votes favors the extension of social benefits and discourages unpopular measures that would put the economy on a more sustainable footing.
As the German economist Herbert Giersch once put it, what is politically expedient is rarely economically beneficial.
It is for this reason that a return to ordoliberalism is more important than ever.
Erhard's objective was to counter political pragmatism and activism with an orderly vision of economic and social policy.
The need to take a holistic view of the economy was self-evident.
For today's social engineers and economists, this is no longer the case.
Erhard's vision of a social market economy was a third way, an alternative to both large-scale state intervention and the risks of laissez-faire liberalism.
Germany's historical experience had demonstrated that freedom without order led to chaos, and order without freedom resulted in coercion and the renunciation of democracy.
Unguided capitalism undermined itself, according to Erhard, as monopolists cornered markets and captured the state.
But the attempt to perfect life through increasingly comprehensive state intervention, until even the smallest injustices were compensated, was also bound to fail.
Human society simply does not follow the rules of a termite colony; order must accommodate freedom and individuality.
The continuing relevance of Erhard's ideas can be seen in the growing number of protest movements – strengthened by social networks – challenging the market economy and neoliberalism.
Any increase in the market's perceived legitimacy brought about by the failure of communism was temporary at best.
Market-oriented policies today are seen as cold and anti-social, especially in Western industrialized countries.
The paternalistic welfare state is viewed as more humane, despite the loss of freedom and the financial distortions associated with it.
Erhard was well aware of the tension between economic freedom and the democratic state.
He and his followers never envisaged ordoliberalism as an unchangeable dogma, but rather as a model that could be adapted to new challenges.
Erhard even attempted to adjust it to the sociopolitical changes of the 1960s, developing the concept of a “formed society," whereby factionalism would be minimized and the state governed by consensus.
Erhard failed to gain support for this controversial idea.
But, given rising inequality and growing disenchantment with politics and political parties, it addresses questions that remain relevant for representative democracy today.
As Erhard himself would have argued, ordoliberalism is not a one-size-fits-all solution.
But there can be no question that in today's globalized world, the economy – and perhaps politics as well – would benefit from the imposition of order.
No political system capable of overcoming hardship and misery can be built without first realizing improvements in the economy's potential.
That must be achieved by minimizing state intervention, bureaucracy, and privileges for the chosen few.
Erhard's guiding principle was simple: there must be guiding principles.
It is an idea that remains as important as ever – in Germany and beyond.
Germany, Europe, and Russia
European unity is indivisible.
When one nation is intimidated or ostracized, all are not free.
Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms that for us.
So a prime objective of the European Union is to promote stability and security through a dynamic structure of economic and political inter-dependence in which all nations have a vested interest.
But such a structure is lacking today between the EU and Russia, to the detriment of all the countries that lie between them.
Thus it is vitally important that Germany has made this a central issue for its EU presidency, which is just beginning.
With high prices for crude oil and natural gas bloating its coffers, Russia is once again aggressively confronting the small and still relatively weak states that fled the eroding Soviet empire 15 years ago.
Given the residual economic and institutional ties born of the Soviet era, Russia’s external influence in this region remains enormous.
But Russia is also now extending its grasp of energy markets beyond those of its immediate neighbors.
Europe’s relationship with Russia is too important for it to be developed in an ad hoc fashion through bilateral arrangements.
Today is Europe’s moment of maximum flexibility; as dependence on Russian energy supplies grows, the EU’s leverage weakens.
So Europe’s strategy cannot be to take the historically well-trodden path of least resistance.
Unfortunately, in the aftermath of the Cold War, it has often been assumed that Russia’s hostile intentions have disappeared, and foreign policy toward Russia has been conducted as if traditional diplomatic considerations no longer apply.
But, of course, they do apply.
Encouraging economic and political reform are important objectives, but they can never serve as a substitute for a serious effort to contain Russia’s deep-seated expansionism.
To be sure, Russia has legitimate security interests in what has been called its “near abroad.”
But Europe’s stability and commitment to economic growth across the continent require that these interests be satisfied without economic pressure or unilateral intervention.
A viable Russia policy for Europe must recognize Europe’s growing dependence on Russian energy resources.
To proceed otherwise would discount the most important question: the reliability of Russia as an energy supplier.
Despite controlling the world’s largest gas reserves, Russia’s state-owned monopoly Gazprom is not producing enough for an economy growing at 6% a year.
Gazprom’s three largest fields, which account for three-quarters of its output, are in decline.
This domestic shortage means that Gazprom is unable to increase supply to Europe, at least in the short term, unless it can buy gas at below-market rates from its Eastern European and Central Asian neighbors and in turn sell it to its European customers at market prices.
At the same time, Russia wants to cater to other markets, notably along its eastern frontier.
The problem is not a lack of reserves, but Gazprom’s investment strategy.
In recent years, the company has spent vigorously on everything but developing its reserves.
It has built or is building pipelines to Turkey and Germany, taken over an oil company, and sought footholds in European distribution markets.
Instead of investing in discovering oil, Gazprom has become the biggest media group in Russia.
All this is done in the name of creating and supporting a national energy champion which also serves as a foreign policy arm of the Kremlin.
Meanwhile, with investment in Gazprom’s core activity – production – steadily declining, a crisis is looming, one that requires the stewardship and steady hand of the EU.
Gazprom’s ambitions for gaining control of pipeline and energy transport infrastructure must be slowed, which requires allowing independent producers to prosper.
Indeed, independent producers already account for 20% of domestic gas sales in Russia.
To boost their output and allow them direct access to European markets will require market-based incentives.
Europe can help by insisting that Russia participate in the European Energy Charter, which calls for Gazprom to grant its production competitors access to Russian pipelines, and for all disputes to be settled by international arbitration.
European competition policy, which successfully brought giant companies like Microsoft into line to promote competition, could help to turn Gazprom into a normal competitor, too.
Europe’s leaders should engage in frank discussions about where European and Russian interests converge or differ, and these discussions should include regional neighbors that are both producer and transit nations, like my own country, Ukraine.
Moscow will understand a policy based on mutual respect for each other’s interests better than simple appeals to goodwill and friendship.
Russia should be welcome in institutions and agreements that foster cooperation, with reciprocal rights and responsibilities.
Russian reform will be impeded, not nurtured, by turning a blind eye to political and economic aggression.
The hard-fought independence of the former Soviet republics must not be tacitly traded away in acquiescence to Russia’s desire for regional hegemony.
Russia’s leaders are entitled to the world’s understanding as they struggle to overcome generations of Soviet misrule.
But they are not entitled to the sphere of influence that Russian tsars and commissars coveted for 300 years.
If Russia is to be a serious partner for Europe, it must be ready to accept the obligations of stability along with the benefits.
If Europe is to ensure its prosperity and energy security, it must demand nothing less.
Europe’s economic struggles are reflected in its political situation, with many European electorates now mired in a sense of hopelessness and sliding toward ideological extremes.
But a forthcoming report by two highly respected economists – Jean Pisani-Ferry, the French government’s Commissioner-General for Policy Planning, and Henrik Enderlein, a key leader of a reformist group of German economists – will propose a way forward.
The task facing Pisani-Ferry and Enderlein is to create a new reform strategy for Europe’s two largest economies, focusing on structural reforms in France and increased investment in Germany.
The hope is that the report, which will be made public on December 1, will provide a breakthrough that can revive, at long last, the eurozone’s growth engine.
The paper was commissioned a few days after the IMF’s Annual Meetings last month, at a gathering of the French finance and economy ministers, Michel Sapin and Emmanuel Macron, and their German counterparts, Wolfgang Schäuble and Sigmar Gabriel.
Though the meeting produced no concrete policy action – as the French daily Le Monde put it, “nothing was asked for, and nothing was obtained” – it could signal the beginning of more effective Franco-German cooperation, guided by the Pisani-Ferry/Enderlein report.
Such cooperation could not come at a better time.
A couple of weeks after the project was initiated, France and Italy submitted revised annual budgets to the European Commission, in which they demanded more fiscal room for maneuver.
The Commission now has until the end of this month to determine whether France has pursued reform diligently enough to avoid penalties for breaking its pledge to cut its budget deficit to less than 3% of GDP by next year.
An effective reform strategy would have to balance the need for budget restraint and macroeconomic stability with growth-enhancing policies.
When it comes to the latter, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s proposals in August – expanded monetary easing, structural reforms (particularly in France and Italy), and some fiscal expansion by countries like Germany – provide a useful framework to be supplemented with concrete measures.
The ECB governing council has already agreed, in principle, to use the first of these policy tools.
But monetary expansion alone will be inadequate to lift the eurozone out of stagnation.
Moreover, many of the structural reforms that are currently being considered or implemented, despite boosting growth in the long term, can have short-term contractionary effects.
This is particularly true of greater labor-market flexibility, a key asset for long-term growth that can lead to a short-term increase in unemployment.
That is why a more expansionary fiscal stance is also vital, with Germany leading the way in deploying increased public investment to “crowd in” private investment and boost competitiveness.
The IMF’s recent World Economic Outlook describes the success of this approach in recessionary environments.
Given that Germany and even France can borrow at record-low interest rates, any reasonably well-designed investment program will strengthen the public sector’s balance sheet.
And, with the eurozone running a current-account surplus of nearly $350 billion – which the euro’s recent decline will bolster further – there is no risk of a eurozone-wide balance-of-payments crisis.
The key is confidence.
Germany must trust that its agreement to loosen the eurozone’s fiscal belt will not lead to a slowdown of structural reforms, and countries like France need to know that excessive austerity will not exacerbate the impact of politically difficult structural reforms in the short run.
In this sense, top-level political support, voiced in a way that elicits the approval of Europe’s citizens, will be crucial.
Gabriel and Macron must lead the charge, backed by Sapin and Schäuble.
Crucially, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French Prime Minister Manuel Valls – not to mention the new Commission – must also step in to offer genuine support for the project.
Waning confidence is a eurozone-wide problem, but the Franco-German relationship lies at its core.
And, as experience has shown, Germany and France can have a major impact when they work together.
The power of that relationship is what the Pisani-Ferry/Enderlein initiative represents – and what could, with sufficient political support, revitalize Europe.
Босқындарды интеграциялауда Германиядан үйренеріміз көп
ДАВОС – Әлем үкіметтері үлкен сын-қатердің алдында тұр.
Соңғы жылдары халықаралық мигранттар саны күрт өсіп, 2015 жылы 244 миллион адамға жетті, яғни 2000 жылмен салыстырғанда 41 пайызға өскен.
Соның ішінде 20 миллион босқын гуманитарлық апаттың алдын алып, қабылдаушы елдердің жылдам әрі жауаптылықпен интеграциялауына мұқтаж болып отыр.
Босқындардың ең көп нөпірі барған елдерге логистиканың ауыр салмағы түсіп тұр.
2015 жылы 1,1 миллион адамды қабылдаған Германия бұл салмақтың қаншалық ауыр екенін жақсы түсінеді.
Бірақ Германия әлі мойыған жоқ.
Керісінше батпан жүкті көтере біліп, үкімет, бизнес, азаматтық қоғам және мемлекеттер арасында тұрақты әріптестік орната отырып, босқындар мен оларды қабылдаушы елдердің мұқтаждықтарын оңтайлы жолмен өтеуге болатынын дәлелдеп берді.
Жетістікке жету үшін әр ел босқындардың қажеттіліктерін тиімді түрде өтеу жолында мүмкіндігі, ресурстары мен құрылымдарының бар екенін көз жеткізуі керек.
Өткел елдер мен баратын елдер арасында басқару мен үйлестіру ұтымды болса, үкіметтер, бизнес өкілдері, үкіметтік емес және жәрдем көрсетуші ұйымдар міндетті түрде кездесетін қиындықтарды оңай жеңе алады. Сонымен бірге өткел елдер мен қабылдаушы елдер босқындарға қажеттіні беру кезінде бо��атын басты қиындықтарға сол босқындардың өздерінің көзімен қарауы керек.
Бағымызға қарай, қажетті ынтымақтастық пен ынта-жігер артып келеді.
Германияда отырып байқағаным – көптеген бизнес ұйымдары гуманитарлық және логистикалық проблемаларды шешу мүмкіндігін қалт жібермей, босқындардың өмірлерін қайта құруға мүмкіндік беретін қызметтерді ұсынып, инфрақұрылым, технология, денсаулық сақтау, қайта даярлау, білім беру сияқты жұмыстардың шығынын бөлісіп жатыр.
Мәселен, 100-ге тарта бизнес мекемелері, соның ішінде есімі белгілі компаниялар жаңа келгендерді интеграциялауға көмектесетін Wir Zusammen (Біз біргеміз) бастамасына бірікті.
Бүгінге дейін осы бастама аясында 1800 босқын жұмыс орындарында өндірістік тәжірибеден, 300 адам оқу тәжірибесінен өтті.
Мен басқаратын PwC Germany фирмасы жаңа келіп, қатты қиындыққа тап болған босқындарға он апталық тілдік және өндірістік курстарды тегін ұсынады.
Босқындардың көбі баспана беру туралы шешім қабылданғанға дейін, яғни үш ай бойы жұмысқа тұра алмайды, қоғаммен интеграциялану бағдарламаларына да көп қатыспайды.
Біз көтерген осы бастаманың және осы тақылеттес басқа идеялардың арқасында босқындар осы уақытта аса қажетті біліктілікке ие болып, еңбек нарығына кіруге дайындалады, мұның сыртында олардың кәсіби мүмкіндіктеріне ресми түрде баға беріледі. Мұндай бастамалар тек босқындарға емес, бизнес құрылымдарына, және соңында Германия экономикасына көмектеседі. 
Тілдік кедергілер мен интеграциялық процестің бас кезіндегі мәдени ерекшеліктерден жасқанбайтын компаниялар құлшыныстары мықты, білім-білігі жоғары адамдарды даярлап, жұмысқа алу мүмкіндігіне ие болады.
Біліктілігі жоғары мамандарға зәру компаниялар үшін бұл – таптырмас олжа.
Өндіріс, денсаулық сақтау және ауруларды күту сияқты салалар еңбек нарығындағы өсімнен ерекше пайда көретін тәрізді.
Босқындарды орналастыруға тырысып жатқан басқа елдер үшін Германияның тәжірибесі жақсы үлгі бола алады.
Босқындардың сапарын төрт кезеңге бөліп қарастыру – ең пайдалы әрі қазір қолдануға болатын қажетті тәжірибе деуге болады.
Транзиттік кезең.
Босқын соғыстың немесе экономикалық мүмкіндік болмауының кесірінен тіршілік шатқаяқтаған елден қашып шықты, бірақ баратын еліне әлі жеткен жоқ.
Бұл – ең қауіпті кезең, бұл кезде босқындарға қорған болар ештеңе жоқ.
Олар тек кездейсоқ жағдаяттарға ғана емес, контрабандашыларға, адам ұрлаушыларға, сондай-ақ олардың әлсіздігін пайдаланғысы келетін басқа да қылмыстық топтарға тәуелді.
Көшіп келу кезеңі.
Уақытша баспана мен көмек алған босқындар аз да болса қорған табады.
Бұл кезеңде олар осы елде тіркеуге тұрып, өздері қалаған елге баспана беру туралы өтініш тапсыра алады.
Қорғау, орналастыру және интеграция.
Өздері таңдаған елге келіп, баспана туралы өтініштерінің жауабын күтіп жатқан босқындар қорғауға алынып, оларға көмек көрсетіледі. Егер өтініштері қанағаттандырылса, онда оларға үй беріліп, жұмыс және оқу бағдарламалары арқылы қоғамға интеграциялау басталады.
Дәл осы кезде бизнес өкілдері үлкен көмек көрсете алады.
Меніңше, нақты жұмыс тәжірибесінен өткізіп, кәсіби мүмкіндіктер берілсе, интеграциялау жұмыстары өте сәтті жүреді.
Еліне қайтару кезеңі.
Егер баспана беру туралы өтініші қанағаттандырылмаса, онда босқын өз еліне қайтуы керек.
Ұзақ мерзім тұрғысынан қарасақ, босқындардың отанындағы жағдай өзгеріп, адам өміріне қауіп азайса, онда тіпті баспана алғандардың өздері де кері қайтуы мүмкін.
Осы кезеңдердің әрқайсысында икемділік пен ресурс қажет болады.
Германиядан көргеніміздей, бизнес ұлттық және жергілікті үкіметтерді қолдауда үлкен рөл ойнауы мүмкін, сол арқылы олар босқындарға, өздеріне және жалпы экономикаға көмектеседі.
Осы тұрғыдан алғанда босқындар дағдарысы – өте үлкен мүмкіндік.
Босқындардың және өзіміздің мүддеміз үшін бұл мүмкіндікті қолдан жіберіп алмауымыз керек.
Еуропа Германияға тізгінді бере ме?
БЕРЛИН – Ұлыбританиядағы «Брекзитті» қолдаушылардың жеңісі, Италиядағы Маттео Рензидің референдумда жеңіліп, қызметінен кетуі, АҚШ-та Дональд Трамптың президент болып сайлануы Батыста және Еуропада билік вакуумын туғызды.
Еуропа экономика және сыртқы саясат мәселелері бойынша бірлескен маңызды шешімдерді қабылдайтын тұста Франция, Ұлыбритания, Испания, Италия сияқты Еуропа одағының ірі мүшелерін ішкі жайттар көбірек толғандырып отыр. Сондықтан Германия канцлері Ангела Меркельге суырылып алға шығып, басшылық ету қажеттігі туып тұр.
Бірақ, егер Германия лидерлігін көрсеткісі келсе, онда ол байланыс пен компромисті қолай көретін Еуропалық әріптестерін қажет етеді. Германияны сынаушылар оны басқа мүше мемлекеттердің саясатқа қатысты ұсыныстарына ашық болуға шақырады, олардың мұнысы жөн.
Бірақ шағымданушылардың көбі Германияны әділетсіз, тіпті кейде өзімшіл деп сипаттайды.
Мәселен, Германия үкіметін 2008 жылғы қаржы дағдарысы кезінде Еуропалық ынтымақтастықтан бас тартты деп айыптады.
Дегенмен, кейбір шараларды тым кеш қолға алып немесе тым үстірт шешімдер қабылдағанымен (мәселен ЕО-дан уақытша шығуды көздейдін «Грекзит» жоспары), Германия үкіметі «Еуропадағы тұрақтылық механизмі» сияқты шұғыл көмек бағдарламаларын қабылдауға, ЕО банк одағын құруға мұрындық болды.  Бастысы, ең ауыр қаржылық жүкті көтеріп келе жатқан да – осы Германия.
Сондай-ақ, Германияны еуробондтарға кепілдік бермеді, трансфер одағына қарсы шықты деп те айыптады.
Бірақ, бұл сыни пікірлер шын ниетпен айтылған жоқ, себебі Франция сияқты кейбір мүше мемлекеттер экономикалық саясатта егемендігінің көп бөлігінен айырылмастан, тәуекелді басқал��рмен бөлісуді қалайды. Германияның үкіметі мен азаматтары еуроны тұрақтандыруға септігін тигізетін терең интеграцияны, соның ішінде фискалдық одақты, басқаларға қарағанда көбірек қолдайды.
Бірақ, бұған қол жеткізу үшін барлық әріптестер саясаттағы егемендік пен тәуекелді бөлісу тұрғысынан ілгері қадам жасауы керек.
Германияға қатысты айтылатын үшінші шағым – бұл ел өте қатаң фискалдық саясат жүргізу арқылы көршілерін қайыршы халге түсіру саясатын жүргізіп отыр, соның нәтижесінде ағымдағы шот профициті ЖІӨ-нің 9 пайызына жақындап қалған.
Мұның қателік болғаны рас.
Бірақ, бұл – ең алдымен Германияның өз проблемасы.
Германияда инвестиция бойынша біраз олқылық бар, бұл ондағы өнім өндіру мен дамуға кесірін тигізіп отыр. Бірақ, дамудың баяулауы, жұмыссыздықтың артуы, бәсекенің азаюы сияқты бүкіл Еуропаны шарпыған дерттерге оның қатысы шамалы.
Германия саясаткерлері бюджет қаржысын қатаң үнемдеуге тым көп мән беріп, Еуропа Орталық банкінің монетарлық саясатын сынау арқылы жұртты шатастырды.
Бірақ олардың бүкіл Еуроодақта экономикалық өсімнің кемігеніне кеюі орынды.
Жалпы айтқанда, немістер – өте еуропашыл жандар, ал Германия үкіметі Еуропа үшін жұрт айтып жүргеннен әлдеқайда көп нәрсе тындырды.
Басшылықтың қателіктерін артынан анықтап, сынап-мінеу оңай.
Бірақ шешім қабылдау кезінде олардың қолында болған ақпаратты саралап, өткеннің сабағын болашаққа  пайдалану – әлдеқайда конструктивті әрекет болар еді. Өткенге қайырыла алсақ, Германия үкіметі ғана емес, кез келген үкімет Грекиядағы қарыз дағдарысы, фискалдық саясат, Брекзит референдумы, және басқа да мәселелер кезінде өзгеше әрекет еткен болар еді.
Яғни, Германия басшылығы үшін Еуропаның басқа ірі мүшелерінің қадамдары жол көрсетер темірқазық бола алар еді.
Егер Германия үкіметі француз, британ және итальян әріптестерінің соңғы жылдарда жүрген ізімен жүрсе, онда Еуропа бүгінгіден әлдеқайда жақсы болған болар ма еді?
Италия мен Грекиядағы дағдарысқа тым кеш үн қатқанымен, Меркель асқан толенранттылық, ашықтық және көрегендік танытты.
Ең басты екі мәселеде – босқындар дағдарысын реттеуде және Ресей агрессиясына тойтарыс беруде ол басқа мүше мемлекеттердің көбіне қарағанда еуропалық ниеттестікті әлдеқайда көбірек паш етті.
Оның үстіне, Меркель Трамптың жеңісіне жауап беруде лидерлігін ерекше көрсетті.
Оны құттықтап, тығыз қарым-қатынасқа шақырған Меркель бұл байланыстың тек «демократия, еркіндік, заң үстемдігі мен әр адамның қадір-қасиетін құрметтеу» сияқты «ортақ құндылықтарға» ғана негізделетінін шегелеп айтты.
Сондай-ақ, ол - алда болатын Брекзит келіссөздері бойынша Ұлыбритания үкіметінің ең басты әрі ең жанашыр серіктесі. 
Еуропаның көп басшылары Меркельдің рейтингіне қызғанышпен қарайды, және ол Батыстағы ірі мемлекеттердің арасындағы тұғыры берік, популист емес басшылардың соңғысы болуы мүмкін.
Италияда 4 желтоқсанда өткен референдум - әлеуметтік араздық пен саяси экстремизмді, күшейіп бара жатқан экономикалық және саяси дағдардыстарды еңсеру жолында бірігіп әрекет етуге жұмылдыратын ұйқыашар қоңырау болған тәрізді. 
Германия үкіметі өткен қателіктерінен сабақ ала отырып, Еуропаның көшбасшысы ретінде әрекетін жалғасыруы керек.
Бірақ ол жалғыз қарекет ете алмайды.
Еуроодақтың басқа мүшелері өз қателіктерінен назарды аударту үшін Германияны төмпештеуді қоюы қажет.
Соңғы жылдары олардың шабуылдары тым өрескел, нәтижесіз болып кетті.
Германия әріптестерінің үстел басына жайғасып, Еуропадағы тереңдеп бара жатқан дағдарысқа қатысты нақты шешім қабылдау үшін конструктивті диалог құрғанын қалайды.
Germany Must Defend the Euro
NEW YORK – Financial markets abhor uncertainty; that is why they are now in crisis mode.
The governments of the eurozone have taken some significant steps in the right direction to resolve the euro crisis but, obviously, they did not go far enough to reassure the markets.
At their meeting on July 21, the European authorities enacted a set of half-measures.
They established the principle that their new fiscal agency, the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), should be responsible for solvency problems, but they failed to increase the EFSF’s size.
This stopped short of establishing a credible fiscal authority for the eurozone.
And the new mechanism will not be operative until September at the earliest.
In the meantime, liquidity provision by the European Central Bank is the only way to prevent a collapse in the price of bonds issued by several European countries.
Likewise, Eurozone leaders extended the EFSF’s competence to deal with banks’ solvency, but stopped short of transferring banking supervision from national agencies to a European body.
And they offered an extended aid package to Greece without building a convincing case that the rescue can succeed: they arranged for the participation of bondholders in the Greek rescue package, but the arrangement benefited the banks more than Greece.
Perhaps most worryingly, Europe finally recognized the principle – long followed by the IMF – that countries in bailout programs should not be penalized on interest rates, but the same principle was not extended to countries that are not yet in bailout programs.
As a result, Spain and Italy have had to pay much more on their own borrowing than they receive from Greece.
This gives them the right to opt out of the Greek rescue, raising the prospect that the package may unravel.
Financial markets, recognizing this possibility, raised the risk premium on Spanish and Italian bonds to unsustainable levels.
ECB intervention helped, but it did not cure the problem.
The situation is becoming intolerable.
The authorities are trying to buy time, but time is running out.
The crisis is rapidly reaching a climax.
Germany and the other eurozone members with AAA ratings will have to decide whether they are willing to risk their own credit to permit Spain and Italy to refinance their bonds at reasonable interest rates.
Alternatively, Spain and Italy will be driven inexorably into bailout programs.
In short, Germany and the other countries with AAA bond ratings must agree to a eurobond regime of one kind or another.
Otherwise, the euro will break down.
It should be recognized that a disorderly default or exit from the eurozone, even by a small country like Greece, would precipitate a banking crisis comparable to the one that caused the Great Depression. It is no longer a question whether it is worthwhile to have a common currency.
The euro exists, and its collapse would cause incalculable losses to the banking system.
So the choice that Germany faces is more apparent than real – and it is a choice whose cost will rise the longer Germany delays making it.
The euro crisis had its origin in German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision, taken in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ default in September 2008, that the guarantee against further defaults should come not from the European Union, but from each country separately.
And it was German procrastination that aggravated the Greek crisis and caused the contagion that turned it into an existential crisis for Europe.
Only Germany can reverse the dynamic of disintegration in Europe.
That will not come easily: Merkel, after all, read the German public’s mood correctly when she made her fateful decision, and the domestic political atmosphere has since become even more inhospitable to extending credit to the rest of Europe.
Merkel can overcome political resistance only in a crisis atmosphere, and only in small steps.
The next step will likely be to enlarge the EFSF; but, by the time that step is taken, France’s AAA rating may be endangered.
Indeed, by the time Germany agrees to a eurobond regime, its own AAA standing may be at risk.
The only way that Europe can escape from this trap is by acting in anticipation of financial markets’ reactions, rather than yielding to their pressure after the fact.
This would require intense debate and soul-searching, particularly in Germany, which, as the EU’s largest and best-rated economy, has been thrust into the position of deciding the future of Europe.
That is a role that Germany has been eager to avoid and remains unwilling to accept.
But Germany has no real choice.
A breakdown of the euro would precipitate a banking crisis that would be beyond the global financial authorities’ ability to control.
The longer Germany takes to recognize this, the higher the price it will have to pay.
Germany’s Strange Turn Against Trade
BERLIN – The window of opportunity to complete the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union is closing quickly.
National elections will be held this year and next in the US, France, and Germany, and the campaigns will play out in an environment that is increasingly hostile to international agreements in any form.
The biggest risk might come from the least likely source: Germany, an export powerhouse.
In fact, Germany – whose economic progress since the end of World War II has been driven by its consistent openness to international trade and economic integration, and which remains one of Europe’s most open and trade-dependent economies – would be among the main beneficiaries of the TTIP.
It is projected that the TTIP would raise annual per capita income in Germany by 1-3%, or €300-1,000 per year by 2035.
Moreover, with nearly 50% of German jobs linked, directly or indirectly, to the tradable sector, the deal would also help protect employment.
And, by boosting the ability of the US and Europe to set global business standards, German firms’ international competitiveness would rise.
Not every individual or company stands to gain from the TTIP, but the net effect on Germany’s economy and citizens would be clearly positive.
Why, then, do so many in Germany oppose the deal?
One reason is that Germany’s apparent economic success has increased aversion to change.
The country not only endured the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the European sovereign debt crisis; it has actually thrived in recent years, experiencing robust GDP growth and impressive wage gains.
The unemployment rate has been halved since 2005, reaching a record low of 4.6% today, and its current-account surplus has soared to a staggering 8% of GDP.
The sense of being Europe’s economic superstar has generated policy inertia, bringing the country almost to a complete standstill on economic reforms.
While most other Europeans are desperately looking for any opportunity to pull their country out of crisis, Germans see little reason to meddle with an ostensibly prosperous status quo.
Unfortunately for Germany, its current path is not as smooth and secure as people like to think.
In fact, since its lost decade as the “sick man of Europe” in the 2000s, Germany has caught up with other advanced economies in only some areas.
It still has one of the lowest rates of public and private investment among OECD countries, and will be hit harder than most by a dramatic demographic shift over the next decade.
Beyond providing an immediate economic boost, the TTIP would help Germany weather the longer-term challenges it faces.
Germany’s opposition to the TTIP also reflects the recent surge in populist and nationalist sentiment in much of the Western world.
The appeal of such forces is particularly pronounced in the EU, owing to the popular perception that European integration has weakened national sovereignty and left citizens subject to decision-making by unelected technocrats.
The last thing many Europeans want is yet another set of supra-national rules, formulated behind closed doors, governing their economies.
This sentiment is especially acute for Germans, who remain bitter at, as they perceive it, having been Europe’s paymaster during the crisis.
Some now fear that the TTIP is just another trick, intended to take advantage of Germany’s economic strength and generosity.
Overcoming this fear will be no easy feat.
A third reason for Germany’s opposition to the TTIP is that the country is already engaged in a battle for wealth redistribution.
Germany currently has the highest inequality in private wealth in the eurozone, and it has experienced a sharp increase in wage inequality over the last two decades.
In fact, many Germans anticipate a further increase in inequality.
Not only is the minimum wage widely circumvented; some politicians have capitalized on fears of the current influx of refugees to win votes, claiming that openness to foreigners will only make inequality worse.
Compounding Germans’ disillusionment is the sense – shared by many in Europe and elsewhere – that the system is “rigged.”
Volkswagen managers received huge bonuses this year, despite the global scandal caused by the company’s years-long effort to evade emissions standards. And the release of the Panama Papers has revealed how the wealthiest avoid paying taxes.
Claims that the TTIP would benefit primarily the wealthy have thus struck a chord with labor unions and others.
A trade-dependent economy has much to gain from freer trade, especially with a market as large as the US.
Germany should be using its political clout to push its European counterparts to seal the deal.
Instead, with the popularity of the country’s two largest political parties, the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats, falling fast, Germany’s leaders are unlikely to push an unpopular deal.
That is bad news for everyone – especially Germans.
Germany’s Drift from Europe
BERLIN – “What’s the matter with Germany?,” people on both sides of the Atlantic are asking with increasing frequency.
In Berlin, however, nobody seems to understand the question.
Doubts about Germany’s role have much to do with the current economic and financial crisis, and also with the weakness of the European Union and its institutions.
Ever since the referendum failures of both the European constitution and the Lisbon treaty, the EU has been flying on autopilot, run by its bureaucrats.
With 27 members and no reform of its institutions and procedures, EU processes have become harrowingly inefficient.
Crises are also always moments of truth, because they relentlessly expose both the strengths and weaknesses of all the players involved.
For that reason, Europe now requires leadership not from a weak EU Commission or from any other European institutions, but from the capitals of its major member countries.
As always, when serious economic and financial matters are at stake, people look to Germany, the EU’s largest economy.
But what they see confounds them, because Germany is openly refusing to lead.
True, Germany has been hit hard – very hard – by the economic crisis.
But its economy is nonetheless stronger than ever after the challenges of reunification and the necessary reform of the country’s labor market and welfare systems.
What amazes our neighbors and partners – and increasingly causes distrust – is that ever since the beginning of the global meltdown last September, the German government has focused almost exclusively on national crisis management, rebuffing any and all attempts at a European approach.
Add to this the palpable tensions in Franco-German relations, the blocking of a common EU gas market, close strategic cooperation with Vladimir Putin’s Russia, etc., and the worries about Germany multiply.
It’s not just that there is fear in Berlin that any European solution would be much more expensive for Germany and take a lot longer; this new form of German euroskepticism also shows a fundamental change of attitude amongst the overwhelming majority of Germany’s political and economic elite.
The change is evident by asking a single question: would it still be possible today to give up the D-Mark and introduce the euro as a common currency?
The answer is a resounding no.
Regardless of whether it’s Chancellor Angela Merkel or Foreign Minister Frank Steinmeier, this answer reverberates across the political spectrum, and it is held irrespective of which parties or people form the government.
Following the changing of the guard after the end of Germany’s red/green coalition, a fundamental shift in attitude has gradually taken place.
Europe today is no longer seen as the key project in German politics in which people are willing to invest an essential part of their political capital – and thus of their own future.
Rather, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, the reunited Germany is beginning to realize that it can also act alone.
The problem, of course, is that this is a huge misapprehension.
Germany’s relationship with Europe is seen as a functional one by nearly all the democratic parties.
But, while Europe no doubt remains important for asserting both common and national interests, it is no longer a project of the future.
All political players in Berlin reject this charge with great indignation.
Indeed, there is no strategy or master plan whatsoever for a return to nationalism.
The fundamental change in Germany’s European policy is simply happening – the result of a process that could almost be termed “organic.”
As such, this does not makes the drift in German policy – which manifests itself, for example, in a refusal to lead in the present crisis – any better.
It is a strategic illusion of the large member states that they can defend their own status without this stolid entity called Europe.
After all, can Germany really afford to let the EU’s enlargement into Eastern Europe fail?
Can it afford a life-threatening crisis of the euro, a common market endangered by growing protectionism, or Russia pushing into the EU’s Eastern neighborhood?
Can it really conduct an independent national policy in the Middle East and Africa, or play an effective role in resolving global issues, from addressing climate change to building a new financial order?
To ask these questions – and many more – is to answer them: only a strong, substantially more integrated EU can manage all this.
But this EU will have a future only if its member governments and peoples are willing to invest a substantial part of their political success and their national interests.
And this applies above all, as it did in the past, to Germany, in the heart of the continent, with the EU’s largest population and economy, and, last but not least, with its difficult past.
Europe’s Economic Groupthink
FRANKFURT – During the recent hearing on the constitutionality of the European Central Bank’s measures to prevent the eurozone from falling apart, Andreas Vosskuhle, President of Germany’s Constitutional Court, raised an important question: Do non-German economists condemn the ECB’s outright monetary transactions (OMT) as unequivocally as all but one of the German experts testifying?
Of course, there are German economists (not to mention Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government) who support ECB President Mario Draghi’s policies.
Still, an overwhelming majority of German (and possibly Dutch and Finnish) economists seem to favor keeping the ECB on the sidelines in the eurozone crisis.
It’s a fiscal issue, the typical German economist says, and monetary policy will not help; on the contrary, activating it will only make matters worse.
Of course, everyone would prefer it if the line between monetary and fiscal policy had not become blurred as a result of the crisis.
But blindly sticking to principle would have been a highly risky option for the ECB.
It would have meant accepting in 2012 what has been called “redenomination risk” – economic newspeak for a eurozone breakup.
Nonetheless, by launching its OMT scheme, the ECB has committed German (and other northern European) taxpayers, without their parliaments’ approval, to a potential obligation to bail out – well, whom, exactly?
Indeed, it appears that the typical northern European taxpayer supports the typical stakeholder in northern European banks that are over-exposed to southern European debtors.
Likewise, German legal scholars interpret the ECB’s activities as being incompatible with European treaty provisions that prohibit bailouts and monetary financing of the debt of eurozone members.
And one can easily understand civil servants’ strong reluctance to disregard legal obligations and risk criminal liability for breach of trust.
Germany’s Constitutional Court, of course, does not write the rules.
But its obligation is to render a dispassionate reading of legal agreements, and it is renowned for doing so, which is one reason why it is the country’s most trusted institution.
Nonetheless, the ECB is right that it is faced with very different monetary conditions in different member states; indeed, the eurozone is akin to a badly working fixed-exchange-rate system, with all of the attendant risks.
Ultimately, limiting the ECB to its conventional tool kit amounts to accepting the risk of a eurozone collapse.
Against this backdrop, institutional investors self-insured – quite rationally – against a eurozone breakup by withdrawing behind safer borders.
With fiscal policy incapable of responding, the ECB was stuck with a second intermediation role: mitigating with its Target2 system the effects of European financial markets re-segmenting along national lines.
This is fiscal dominance in its purest form.
It is here that Vosskuhle’s question matters the most.
Debates within eurozone member states typically converge on what legal scholars call herrschende Meinung (“dominant opinion”), which, in turn, appears to reflect their countries’ status as creditors or debtors.
Reinforcing this, the typical career-conscious economist has little incentive to deviate.
The media are no remedy, as competition for ratings forces them to favor oversimplification over differentiation, complexity, and nuance.
In terms of substance – which the German Constitutional Court explicitly and intentionally avoids – the case for OMT has always been about preventing a liquidity crisis from morphing into a solvency problem, especially on the eurozone’s periphery.
From an investor’s perspective, the mechanics of this are simple: all are reluctant to hold private or public debt from a country that is vulnerable to redenomination.
This by itself creates a rollover risk, which is why, for example, a small firm in Bozen (Bolzano, in Italy’s South Tyrol) is subject to higher financing costs than its competitor in Innsbruck (in Austria’s northern Tyrol).
The OMT scheme’s success depends on an unlimited capacity to intervene – to do “whatever it takes,” as Draghi famously put it.
Legally constraining this capacity would be self-defeating.
So, if the OMT scheme is not feasible under current treaty provisions, these provisions – which, after all, are of human, not divine, origin – must be amended.
But a treaty change would require engaging the European public – and, in several member states, submitting the proposed revisions to popular referenda.
Given how often such referenda have been defeated in recent years – for example, in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland – that is a scenario that everyone wants to avoid.
What is dispiriting is that we ponder these arguments so infrequently.
In fact, the minimal prerequisites for a working monetary union are not discussed upfront and transparently anywhere.
With politicians focused on the median voter, and a groupthink-generating media, the eurozone muddles through, just barely surviving.
But, if the eurozone is to be a sensible long-term proposition, mere survival is not enough.
The main justification for a monetary union cannot be the possibly disastrous consequences of its falling apart.
Even less convincing is the neo-mercantilist point that the eurozone would allow for indefinite current-account surpluses (it does not).
Originally, Europe’s monetary union was supposed to provide a stable framework for its deeply integrated economies to enhance living standards sustainably.
It still can.
But this requires acknowledging what the crisis has revealed: the eurozone’s institutional flaws.
Remedying them calls for a minimum of federalism and commensurate democratic legitimacy – and thus for greater openness to institutional adaptation.
Germany’s Fiscal Follies
PRINCETON – All over the world, public-sector deficits are exploding.
Governments face massive costs rescuing banks and businesses hit by the financial and economic crisis.  There is a universal consensus that Keynesian stimulus is needed.
At the same time, policymakers are looking more and more nervously for an “exit strategy.”
They know that they cannot run deficits forever, but they do not want to say when the painful exit should begin.
Germany is different, not because it is not spending now, but in how it talks about the future.
The German government has taken a peculiarly aggressive line in attacking deficits and in trying to lay down a firm exit strategy.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has criticized the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England for “quantitative easing,” which has in practice allowed the central bank to monetize many types of government and non-government debt.
The German government also successfully passed a constitutional law requiring the government deficit to be capped at 0.35% of GDP in 2016 and eliminated by 2020.
Both the attacks on excessively easy central banks and the effort to limit government debt are enormously popular in Germany.
But they have been widely condemned by economists worldwide (including in Germany) as nonsense.
Merkel is not the first German politician to adopt a hardline stance on monetary policy and debt – nor is she the first to face a torrent of international criticism.
In the late 1970’s, when the world was facing a mixture of stagnant growth and inflation, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt insistently told British, French, and American leaders that their deficits were wrong and dangerous.
He believed that the solution to stagflation “was that those with deficits should get rid of them.”
His fellow leaders began to think Schmidt arrogant.
The most obvious explanation for the German peculiarity is an obsession with the lessons of German history, particularly the two episodes of runaway inflation in the twentieth century, in which holders of monetary assets were expropriated.
The Great Inflation of the early 1920’s, which culminated in a hyper-inflation in which prices changed several times daily, destroyed the middle classes and bred the political instability that eventually opened the way to Hitler’s rise.
Hitler repeatedly promised that he would use any means to fight inflation, but his militarism also led to the expropriation of savings.
Even though only quite old people have personally experienced even the second of these episodes of monetary destruction, their political resonance is still acute.  Germany’s mass circulation Bild Zeitung warned in a headline in March 2009 of inflation at a time when all price signals pointed in the opposite direction.
Merkel has acute political antennae, and her response struck a deep chord with popular sentiment.
A second rationale for Germany’s policy is demographic.
Budget limitation appeals not just to the old, but is especially attractive to young people, who worry that they will be made to pay the costs of caring for an increasingly elderly and dependent population.
There is a third explanation for Germany’s particular stance.
With governments around the world (including Germany’s) accumulating unprecedented levels of peacetime debt, markets are worrying about sustainability.
Some crisis-prone countries such as Latvia are already unable to sell any more debt.
But even large and stable countries such as Britain and the US are finding auctions of government paper increasingly problematic.
Big investors, particularly Asian countries’ reserve funds, are increasingly nervous.
A cast-iron mechanism to ensure that the debt build-up does not continue forever is appealing as a way of withstanding increasingly fraught competition for funding.
Germany will look like a better credit risk, thereby allowing it to fund its current budget deficits more easily and cheaply.
There is obviously some element of bluff in legislating balanced budgets.
Extravagant promises to behave better at some future point are not completely credible, although they often have a short-term impact.
In 1985, the US Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman Act, which provided for automatic spending cuts in the case of deficits.

A “progressive federalist” program would substantially increase this type of spending and rigorously evaluate it.
Such a program would set high federal standards but allow cities and states to innovate, then fund what works.
It’s time to think differently and align our thinking – and our spending – with what actually works.
Fighting Terrorism Democratically
Bombings in London and Turkey have brought to the fore the old ideas that authoritarian regimes are better equipped than democracies to combat terrorism, and that such attacks are the price we pay for liberty.
For some, that is a price worth paying; for others, the costs seem too high.
But a look at the record shows that democracies possess more effective weapons to fight terror than do authoritarian regimes.
Indeed, it is when democracies abandon their ethics and fail to resist the authoritarian temptation that they become weaker. 
Of course, the logic behind calls to restrict our freedoms has a simplistic appeal: extremists use our freedoms to commit their crimes, so preventing the abuse of freedom requires curtailing freedom’s scope.
The mistake, however, is to assume that open societies are more permissive and vulnerable to terrorism than those who live under authoritarian regimes.
One need only look at today’s Russia, or recall Algeria in the 1990’s.
True, democracy and the rule of law provide no foolproof security guarantee.
But such a guarantee is a mirage anyway, whereas respect for basic freedoms and due process when repressing terrorism is a powerful instrument to isolate extremists and diminish their legitimacy in the eyes of those that might identify with their cause.
It is because Britain is a democracy that respects the rule of law that it has been able to mobilize vast sectors of its Muslim community.
By contrast, authoritarian regimes’ repression of civilians, and their non-differentiation between civilians and killers, provides extremists with fertile recruiting conditions by discrediting the government in the eyes of a significant part of its population.
An undifferentiated approach towards political Islamism that fails to distinguish between those who reject violence and those who resort to terror only facilitates the extremists’ work, for they emerge as champions of causes that do not reflect their true goals.
Russia provides conclusive evidence of the impotence of authoritarian violence and disregard for the rule of law.
President Vladimir Putin undertook a scorched-earth policy in Chechnya, driving many Chechen nationalists straight into the extremists’ arms.
Terrorist attacks on Russia did not cease or decline.
Indeed, recall the terrorism in Beslan in September 2004, in which a single attack on a school killed over 330 people.
Iraq also is demonstrating the limits of illegitimate violence when combating terrorism.
The Bush administration now seems to realize this.
It would be a mistake to believe that the deaths of thousands of civilians, along with arbitrary imprisonment and torture, do not contribute to the spread of terror in Iraq.
After all, torture victims are the best possible advertisement for terrorist recruitment.
When it comes to fighting terrorism, moreover, democracies are more effective both politically and operationally, particularly in terms of their intelligence services.
Intelligence forces in authoritarian states are either highly centralized or tend to become autonomous power centers.
In either case, they are subject to no public scrutiny and accountability.
As a result, they lose their ability over time to evaluate critically their own actions and errors.
Intelligence services in democratic contexts usually have oversight mechanisms that serve to limit abuses of power, and to guarantee effective action by punishing top officials that fail to do their jobs properly.
In the United States, a powerful bi-partisan Senate committee directly monitors the intelligence services.
Its report on the inability of the intelligence services, notably the CIA and the FBI, to prevent the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks also contained a series of recommendations for restructuring these services to render them more effective.
Europe’s response to terror requires, first and foremost, strengthening its intelligence services so that they can detect and dismantle terrorist cells while respecting basic rights and due process.
It also requires greater coordination among all the European Union’s member states and their allies and partners.
At the same time, the rule-of-law approach to fighting terrorism must be a pillar of European cooperation with third countries, namely with those of the Mediterranean, or with Pakistan, thereby contributing to a security culture that is conducive to democratization.
Deepening democracy in turn means allowing full civic participation, including non-violent Islamic groups.
The right to public speech and peaceful assembly must be defended for those who feel marginalized and indignant at what they – and most Europeans – view as injustices committed against the Palestinians, the Chechens, and the Iraqis.
Last, but not least, combating identity-based extremism calls for a greater capacity to integrate all those who live within the EU.
The response to terrorism should be to reaffirm the value of the rule of law over arbitrary repression, and of the diversity that is the hallmark of Europe’s cities, particularly London and Paris, but increasingly many others across the Union.
We cannot – indeed, must not – cede to terror by building walls around and within our societies.
The best response to intolerant extremism is to cultivate an open and pluralistic society that treats all those who live within its borders as full citizens.
Europe turned diversity into one of its constitutional traits, and this is why it has had such an impact on the world.
Protecting that essence is the best way to honor the memory of the victims of terror, be they from London, Sharm el-Sheik, Madrid, Casablanca, or New York.
Fighting the \
As the US presidential heats up, critics argue that President George W. Bush's war in Iraq has made the problem of combating terrorism worse.
It is a serious charge, because the world needs a broader strategy against terrorism.
Terrorism is nothing new, nor is it a single enemy.
It is a longstanding method of conflict frequently defined as deliberate attack on the innocent with the objective of spreading fear.
The attacks on New York and Washington of 2001 were dramatic escalations of an age-old phenomenon.
Terrorism today, however, is different from what it was in the past.
Nowadays, instruments of mass destruction are smaller, cheaper, and more readily available.
Cellular phones were used as timers in the attacks in Madrid last March. Hijacking an airplane is relatively inexpensive.
Finally, the information revolution provides inexpensive means of communication and organization that allow groups once restricted to local and national police jurisdictions to become global.
Al Qaeda is said to have established a network in fifty or more countries.
Changes have also occurred in the motivation and organization of terrorist groups.
Terrorists in the mid-20th century tended to have relatively well-defined political objectives, which were often ill-served by mass murder. Governments supported many covertly.
Toward the century's end, radical groups grew on the fringes of several religions.
Most numerous were the tens of thousands of young Muslims who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, where they were trained in a wide range of techniques and many were recruited to organizations with an extreme view of the religious obligation of jihad .
These technological and ideological trends increased both the lethality and the difficulty of managing terrorism.
Because of the unprecedented scale of Al Qaeda's attacks, the focus is properly on Islamic extremists.
But it would be a mistake to limit our concern solely to Islamic terrorists, for that would ignore the way that technology is putting into the hands of deviant groups and individuals' destructive capabilities that were once limited primarily to governments and armies.
Deviant individuals and groups exist in all human societies, and they are now empowered in ways that were once unthinkable.
Think, for example of Timothy McVeigh, who bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, or the Aum Shinrykio cult that released poison gas in the Tokyo subway system the same year.
Lethality has been increasing.
In the 1970's, the Palestinian attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics and attacks by groups like the Red Brigades galvanized world attention at the cost of dozens of lives.
In the l980's, the worst terrorist incident killed 300 people.
The attacks on America of September 2001 cost several thousand lives.
This escalation occurred without using weapons of mass destruction.
If one imagines a deviant group in some society gaining access to biological or nuclear materials, it is possible terrorists could destroy millions of lives.
To kill so many people in the 20th century, a Hitler or Stalin required the apparatus of a totalitarian government.
It is now easy to envisage extremist groups and individuals killing millions without government help
Politics has plagued efforts to agree on a common definition of terrorism at the United Nations.
Some skeptics argue that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, and that treating suppression of terrorism as a global public good is thus merely the hypocrisy of the powerful trying to disarm the weak.
That need not be the case.
Not all struggles for national liberation turn to deliberate killing of innocents.
Deliberate killing of non-combatants (in war or not) is condemned by most major religions, including Islam.
Such behavior is unacceptable whether it is carried out by the powerful or the weak.
While any definition of terrorism has problems at the margins, the core of terrorism is clear enough to permit efforts to de-legitimize it.
Indeed, many countries are parties to UN conventions that commit them to combating aspects of terrorist behavior, even though the UN has not agreed on a single formal definition.
Today, some states harbor terrorists in order to attack their enemies or because they are too weak to control powerful groups.
If a campaign to suppress terrorism is based on broad coalitions that focus on de-legitimizing attacks on innocent non-combatants, it has some prospect of success.
Indeed, one lesson of the efforts since 2001 is that there is no way to avoid broad cooperation.
In that sense, the metaphor of war - with its emphasis on military force is - misleading.
The metaphor of war was understandable in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks, but creates as many problems as it solves.
How long will the war last and how does it relate to civil liberties and alliances?
Bombing is not an option for fighting terrorist cells in Hamburg, Singapore, or Detroit.
Only close civilian cooperation in intelligence sharing, police work across borders, tracing financial flows, and working to pre-clear cargo manifests and passenger lists can cope with such a threat.
Countries cooperate out of self-interest, but a country's soft or attractive power, not only its military might, affects the degree of cooperation.
That is why critics argue that Bush's policy in Iraq was a mistake.
It squandered American soft power, diverted attention from Afghanistan and Al Qaeda, and created a danger that Iraq may become a haven for terrorists.
But critics of Bush at home and abroad must also realize that, notwithstanding past mistakes, pursuing a common strategy is essential, because terrorism is here to stay.
Fighting Words and False Promises
For almost five years, the â€œwar on terrorâ€ has proved to be a false metaphor that has led to counterproductive and self-defeating policies.
A misleading figure of speech has been applied literally to unleash a real war on several fronts, including Iraq, Gaza, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Somalia.
Thousands of innocent civilians have been killed, enraging millions around the world.
Yet al-Qaeda has not been subdued, as was shown by the recent plot to blow up United States-bound commercial flights from London.
That plot, which could have claimed more victims than the 9/11 attacks, was foiled by the vigilance of the British intelligence authorities.
Clearly, it wonâ€™t be the last.
Unfortunately, the American public accepted uncritically the war metaphor as the obvious response to 9/11.
Indeed, even now, when it is widely admitted that the invasion of Iraq was a blunder, the â€œwar on terrorâ€ remains the frame into which American policy has to fit.
Most Democratic politicians, too, subscribe to it for fear of being branded as weak on defense.
But continuing support for the war on terror makes it no less self-defeating.
By its very nature, war creates innocent victims, and this even more likely when it is waged against terrorists, because terrorists tend to keep their whereabouts hidden.
The deaths, injuries, and humiliation of civilians generate rage and resentment among their families and communities, in turn fueling support for terrorists.
Moreover, terrorism is an abstraction that lumps together all political movements that use terrorist tactics.
Al-Qaeda, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Sunni insurrection and the Mahdi army in Iraq are very different forces, but President George W. Bushâ€™s global war on terror prevents us from differentiating between them and dealing with them accordingly.
It inhibits much-needed negotiations with Iran and Syria, because they are states that support terrorist groups.
At the same time, as the British have shown, groups like al-Qaeda are best dealt with by good intelligence.
The war on terrorâ€™s emphasis on military action merely increases the terrorist threat and makes the task of the intelligence agencies more difficult.
On the contrary, an endless war waged against an unseen enemy is doing great damage not only to our authority and prestige in the world, but also to our own society.
It has led to a dangerous extension of executive powers, tarnished our adherence to universal human rights, and inhibited the critical process that is at the heart of an open society.
It has also cost a lot of money.
Most importantly, the war on terror has diverted attention from other urgent tasks that require American leadership, such as finishing the job that we correctly began in Afghanistan, addressing the looming global energy crisis, and dealing with nuclear proliferation.
With American influence at low ebb, the world is in danger of sliding into a vicious cycle of escalating violence.
We can escape it only if we Americans repudiate the war on terror as a false metaphor.
If we persevere on our current course, the situation will continue to deteriorate.
It is not our will that is being tested, but our understanding of reality.
It is painful to admit that our predicaments are brought about by our own misconceptions.
But not admitting it is bound to prove even more painful in the long run.
The strength of an open society lies in its ability to recognize and correct its mistakes.
That is the test that now confronts us.
Can Fillon Beat Le Pen?
CAMBRIDGE – In the French Republican party’s presidential primary on Sunday, François Fillon soundly defeated frontrunner Alain Juppé, winning close to 67% of the votes.
Two weeks ago, a landslide victory for the apparent underdog seemed out of the question.
It had long been expected that Juppé, the mayor of Bordeaux and a former prime minister under President Jacques Chirac, would beat the other frontrunner, former President Nicolas Sarkozy, in a second-round runoff.
Instead, Fillon, a former prime minister under Sarkozy, emerged from the first round with a commanding lead, winning 44% of the vote.
The outcome was a humiliating one for Sarkozy, who received just a little over 20% support, and effectively ended his political career.
For many observers, the vote invoked the specter of June’s Brexit referendum and US President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier this month.
Opinion polls placing Fillon as a distant third were proven wrong, partly because many voters seem to have made up their minds just days before the vote.
Social media were also credited, again, with playing a key role.
In the last debates before the vote, Fillon presented himself as a credible alternative to Juppé and Sarkozy.
With incumbent President François Hollande’s approval ratings below 5% – the lowest ever for a French president – the big question now is whether Fillon can beat far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the second round of the presidential election in May 2017.
Juppé was seen as a sufficiently “soft” candidate, who would provide an alternative to Le Pen for left-wing voters.
Fillon, however, is much further to the right than Juppé, which means that left-wing voters might not see much difference between him and Le Pen, and could demand that a center-left third candidate enter the fray.
One contender is the centrist Emmanuel Macron, who says he will run but refuses to stand in the Socialist Party primary this January.
Without major-party backing beyond his own En Marche! movement, however, Macron is unlikely to be able to muster the support needed to win the presidency (he currently has just 14% support).
And, as a banker-turned-reformist economy minister under Hollande, Macron is an ideal target for Le Pen’s anti-elitist, anti-European rhetoric.
Beyond Macron, the left is struggling to put forward a credible candidate.
Holland’s reelection chances are dismal; his loyal prime minister, Manuel Valls, is expected to announce his own candidacy this week, but is polling only marginally better than Hollande, at 9%.
That leaves only the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon (13%) and the photogenic but waffling Arnaud Montebourg, whom Macron succeeded as economy minister.
If no leftist candidate makes it to the second round, voters on the left could cast their votes for “Republican unity,” as they did in 2002, when they handed Chirac a landslide victory over Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
Leftist voters would have preferred Juppé, and will likely tolerate Fillon, but they comprised only 15% of total voters in the first round of the Republican primary, so they may not have the same impact in 2017 as they did in 2002.
Fillon’s political base is dominated by provincial, retired Catholic men, who turned out in force for both rounds of the primaries.
Fillon’s supporters seem to be united in their opposition to gay marriage, and Fillon, as an avowed Catholic, was the most socially conservative candidate on offer.
While Fillon does not want to revoke same-sex couples’ legal right to marry, he opposes granting them the right to adopt children.
Geographically, Fillon won almost everywhere outside of Juppé’s Bordeaux bastion, including the southern Mediterranean Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (PACA) region, which was originally Sarkozy’s strongest base of support.
But PACA is also the National Front’s stronghold, which means that Fillon will have to distinguish himself from Le Pen as a right-wing candidate, lest voters decide they would prefer the original to the copy.
There are a few areas where Fillon and Le Pen differ.
For starters, Florian Philippot, one of Le Pen’s deputies, is openly gay, and Le Pen has been careful not to take a strong position on social issues.
Fillon is also an economic liberal – and is often characterized as a French Margaret Thatcher – whereas Le Pen is a protectionist.
And while Fillon wants to reduce the French civil service by 500,000, Le Pen favors a strong state.
Finally, Le Pen opposes France’s membership in the European Union and wants to return to the franc, while Fillon would prefer to delegate power back to national assemblies.
Heading into the election campaign, Fillon may run on a pro-European platform, as evidenced by his pivot during the second-round debates, when he suggested that he favors forming a eurozone government.
Unlike Trump and the United Kingdom’s “Leave” campaign, the National Front already has a predictable core constituency, amounting to about one-quarter of the electorate.
Its coalition of the old French far right and disaffected working-class voters will not arrive unannounced or defy expectations, as happened in the US and the UK.
Fillon, for his part, can probably muster the same level of support, and he may even be able to skim votes from Le Pen, given that around 8% of primary voters described themselves as National Front backers.
What’s more, political Catholicism still appeals to many French voters, and the Church itself wants to lure Catholics away from the National Front and back into its more traditionally conservative fold.
Meanwhile, a number of far-right organizations supported Fillon’s candidacy during the primaries, owing to his strong support for laws that would ban the burkini, a full-body bathing suit worn by Muslim women.
Given the current political field, Fillon will most likely face Le Pen in the presidential election’s second round next May.
Polling after Fillon’s victory put his support at 26%, with Le Pen backed by 24% of respondents.
Fillon, however, is projected to win the second round with 67% of the vote.
We have been here before, and that second-round projection is based on “Republican unity,” which might not hold.
Left-wing voters, put off by Fillon’s liberal economics and social conservatism, might stay home.
Given pollsters’ massive predictive failures elsewhere this year, no one should count on them to turn out until the votes themselves are counted.
Finance Agonistes
LONDON – For at least a quarter-century, the financial sector has grown far more rapidly than the economy as a whole, both in developed and in most developing countries.
The ratio of total financial assets (stocks, bonds, and bank deposits) to GDP in the United Kingdom was about 100% in 1980, while by 2006 it had risen to around 440%.
In China, financial assets went from being virtually non-existent to well over 300% of GDP during this period.
As the size of the financial industry grew, so, too, did its profitability.
The share of total profits of companies in the United States represented by financial firms rocketed from 10% in 1980 to 40% in 2006.
Against that background, it is not surprising that pay in the financial sector soared.
The City of London, lower Manhattan, and a few other centers became money machines that made investment bankers, hedge-fund managers, and private equity folk immoderately wealthy.
University leaders like me spent much of our time persuading them to recycle a portion of their gains to their old schools.
For the last two years, things have been different.
Many financial firms have shrunk their balance sheets dramatically, and of course some have gone out of business altogether.
Leverage is down sharply. Investment banks with leverage of more than 30 times their capital in early 2007 are now down to little more than ten times.
Trading volumes are down, as is bank lending, and there have been major layoffs in financial centers around the globe.
Is this a short-term phenomenon, and will we see an early return to rapid financial-sector growth as soon as the world economy recovers?
Already the market is full of rumors that guaranteed bonuses are returning, that hedge funds are making double-digit returns, and that activity is reviving in the private equity market.
Are these harbingers of a robust recovery for the financial sector, or just urban myths?
There is no certain answer to that question, but perhaps economic history can offer some clues.
A recent analysis by Andy Haldane of the Bank of England of long-term returns on UK financial sector equities suggests that the last 25 years have been very unusual.
Suppose you had placed a long-term bet on financial equities in 1900, along with a short bet on general equities – in effect a gamble on whether the UK financial sector would outperform the market.
For the first 85 years, this would have been a very uninteresting gamble, generating an average return of only around 2% a year.
But the period from 1986 to 2006 was radically different.
During those two decades, your annual average return would have been more than 16%.
As Haldane puts it, “banking became the goose laying the golden eggs.”
Indeed, there is no period in recent UK financial history that bears any comparison to those jamboree decades.
If you had unwound your bet three years ago, you would now be sitting pretty – as long as you had gone into cash, of course – because the period since 2006 has undone most of these gains.
So if you had held your bank stocks up to the end of last year, over 110 years your investment would have yielded an annual average return of less than 3%, still broadly a break-even strategy.
Why was this 20-year experience so unusual, with returns so much higher than at any time in the last century?
The most straightforward answer seems to be leverage.
Banks geared up dramatically, in a competitive race to generate higher returns.
Haldane describes this as resorting to the roulette wheel.
Perhaps that analogy is rather insulting to those who play roulette.
Indeed, the phrase “casino banking” tends to ignore the fact that casinos have a rather good handle on their returns.
They are typically very astute at risk management, unlike many of the banks that dramatically increased their leverage – and thus their risks – during the last 20 years.
The conclusions that we might draw for the future depend heavily on how central banks and regulators react to the crisis.
At present, financial firms are learning the lessons for themselves, reducing leverage and hoarding capital and cash, whereas the authorities are trying to persuade banks to expand lending – precisely the strategy that led to the current crisis.
Of course, we know that a different approach will be needed in the longer run.
In effect, the authorities are following the approach first outlined by St. Augustine.
They would like banks to be “chaste,” but not yet.
But when growth does return, leverage will be far more tightly constrained than it was before.
Regulators are already talking about imposing leverage ratios, as well as limits on risk-weighted assets.
If they follow through, as I expect, there will be no return to the strategies of the last two decades.
In that case, finance will no longer be an industry that systematically outpaces the rest of the economy.
There will be winners and losers, of course, but systematic sectoral out-performance looks unlikely.
What that will mean for financial-sector pay is a slightly more complex question, to which I will return.
Membiayai Transisi Perubahan Iklim
POTSDAM, PARIS, ZURICH – Jika dunia tidak mengurangi emisi gas rumah kaca secara cepat, kemanusiaan akan memasuki era dengan resiko iklim yang sangat buruk.
Peristiwa-peristiwa cuaca yang ekstrim dan merusak telah meningkat frekuensinya, namun sebagian besar dari kerusakan terburuk yang berkaitan dengan iklim, seperti peningkatan permukaan laut yang terus terjadi, akan hanya disadari saat sudah terlampau terlambat untuk bertindak.
Jelas, horizon waktu sistem iklim tidak sesuai dengan siklus ekonomi dan politik dunia yang lebih singkat.
Laporan tiga bulanan dari perusahaan-perusahaan yang terdafatar, dan perubahan-perubahan peraturan akhir-akhir ini, seperti yang memandatkan peningkatan penggunaan akuntansi “mark-to-market” yang mencatat nilai perusahaan berdasarkan harga pasar saat itu, membatasi pemikiran jangka panjang.
Pemerintah biasanya memiliki siklus legislatif tidak lebih dari empat tahun, dan mereka juga harus menanggapi pembangunan yang secepatnya.
Namun, menstabilisasi iklim membutuhkan tindakan berkelanjutan dan konsisten selama periode yang panjang.
AXA dan UBS, bersama dengan Potsdam Institute untuk Penelitian Dampak Iklim atau Climate Impact Research, CDP (sebelumnya Carbon Disclosure Project), dan Komunitas Informasi dan Pengetahuan Iklim Uni Eropa atau EU’s Climate-KIC (Knowledge and Information Community) baru-baru ini menyelenggarakan konferensi di Berlin.
Di sana, mereka berdiskusi dengan para ahli mengenai investasi hijau dan divestasi bahan bakar fosil mengenai bagaimana para perantara keuangan dapat membantu mengatasi resiko-resiko iklim.
Keikutsertaan aktif industri keuangan sangat diperlukan.
Dalam perjanjian iklim Paris yang dihasilkan Desember kemarin, negara-negara di seluruh dunia setuju untuk membatasi pemanasan global agar di bawah 2° Celsius, dan memutuskan jalur mana yang harus dilakukan oleh dunia secara cepat.
Selama 15 tahun mendatang, diperkirakan $93 triliun akan diperlukan untuk investasi dalam infrastruktur karbon rendah.
Pendanaan pemerintah saja tidak dapat memenuhi permintaan ini, sehingga sektor keuangan harus membantu menutup kesenjangan ini.
Dengan mengarahakan aliran modal menuju upaya-upaya yang pro-aktif untuk memitigasi dan beradaptasi terhadap perubahan iklim, institusi-institusi keuangan dapat melindungi aset klien dari resiko-resiko iklim global, dan dari resiko-resiko ekonomi yang disebabkan oleh planet yang memanas.
Mereka juga menunjukkan tanggung jawab sosial mereka atas kesejahteraan generasi mendatang.
Namun perubahan pembiayaan membutuhkan pembiayaan yang berubah.
Dan proses ini sedang berjalan.
Lembaga-lembaga pembangunan seperti Bank Dunia mempertimbangkan kembali kebijakan-kebijakan investasinya.  Dan, dalam sektor swasta, ada antusiasme yang meningkat terhadap obligasi, pinjaman, indeks, dan investasi infrastruktur “hijau”.
Tetap saja, seperti yang dicatat oleh Komisi Eropa, kurang dari 1% aset lembaga seluruh dunia ditanamkan pada aset infrastruktur yang ramah lingkungan.
Melihat tingkatan bunga yang rendah sepanjang sejarah dan kurangnya pilihan-pilihan penanaman modal yang menarik, ini adalah saat yang ideal untuk melihat keinginan investor yang meningkat terhadap produk-produk keuangan hijau.
Banyak lembaga keuangan besar yang baru-baru ini bergabung dengan inisiatif yang mendukung divestasi bahan bakar fosil.
Temuan-temuan penelitian mengindikasikan bahwa emisi CO2 global harus dibatasi sampai kurang dari satu triliun ton persegi anatara tahun 2010 dan akhir abad ini untuk memenuhi perjanjian Paris dan membatasi pemanasan global sampai di bawah 2°C. Ini berarti bahwa sebagian besar cadangan batu bara, minyak, dan gas harus tetap dibatasi atau bahkan dihilangkan.
Sebagai hasilnya, penanaman modal dalam sumber-sumber energi akan terus turun nilainya sejalan berjalannya waktu, dan akhirnya akan terbengkalai.
Maka, revaluasi sektor keuangan dalam hal hal tersebut tidak hanya akan menstabilisasi iklim, namun akan lebih baik melindungi penanaman modal klien mereka, dan dengan mencegah terciptanya “gelembung karbon,” membantu menstabilisasi ekonomi.
Namun, menjual hal-hal tersebut tidak cukup; Aset yang dibebaskan juga harus diarahkan untuk usaha-usaha yang berkelanjutan.
Agar lembaga-lembaga keuangan dan penanam modal melakukan tugasnya, mereka memerlukan pemahaman yang lebih baik mengenai resiko-resiko investasi yang berkaitan dengan iklim, yang telah dibagi oleh Dewan Stabilitas Keuangan atau Financial Stability Board (FSB) telah dibagi menjadi tiga kategori: fisik, transisional, dan liabilitas.
Keputusan-keputusan investasi akan membutuhkan data yang baik, berdasarkan hal yang ilmiah, dan standar-standar seragam untuk menilai resiko-resiko tersebut,dan untuk menghitung kesempatan-kesempatan yang dapat terbuka karena hal-hal tersebut.
Penyingkapan yang efektif adalah bagian kunci dari kerangka baru manapun.
Sebuah gugus tugas FSB – yang terdiri dari perwakilan-perwakilan bank, asuransi, investor lembaga, lembaga pemeringkat, konsultan, dan auditor – saat ini sedang membentuk standar-standar suka rela, sehingga perusahaan-perusahaan menyediakan penyingkapan keuangan yang berhubungan dengan iklim secara konsisten dan dapat dibandingkan.
Ini juga memperbolehkan perusahaan untuk mendapatkan masukan-masukan untuk potensi mereka sendiri untuk berubahan, merefleksikan prinsip-prinsip yang dihargai waktu: apa yang bisa diukur, akan diatur.
Ini bukan tugas yang mudah.
Sebagai contoh, jejak karbon itu sendiri tidak akan mengubah penanaman modal ke arah yang benar.
Bukannya mengidentifikasi champion-champion untuk solusi yang ramah lingkungan, figur-figur ini hanya mengidentifikasi perusahaan apa saja yang saat ini menghasilkan gas rumah kaca terbesar.
Standar-standar penyingkapan yang baik harus memperhitungkan informasi yang spesifik mengenai sektor dan dampaknya terhadap strategi-strategi bisnis dari transisi menuju ekonomi berkarbon rendah.
Semua pemerintah yang menandatangani perjanjian Paris saat ini dapat diharapkan untuk mengadopsi beberapa tindakan yang membantu mereka menjalankan strategi-strategi de-karbonisasinya.
Dalam konteks ini, pemberian harga karbon adalah bagian penting dari pembuatan kebijakan.
Beberapa pemerintah telah mengambil langkah-langkah untuk mendorong perkembangan produk-produk hijau, melalui insentif pasar atau pajak.
Secara keseluruhan, perubahan-perubahan terhadap kerangka hukum tersebut harus mendukung, dan tidak menghambat, upaya-upaya sektor keuangan swasta untuk mengatasi perubahan iklim.
Membiayai proyek-proyek infrastruktur ini terlalu mahal untuk beberapa pemerintah untuk membiayainya sendiri, namun, penting untuk transformasi sistem energi kita – seperti pembangkit listrik tenaga angin dan kabel listrik jarak jauh – akan membutuhkan sebuah kelas baru obligasi infrastruktur.
Di masa lalu, pemerintah telah mendorong penanaman modal dalam hal obligasi pemerintah.
Sekarang, untuk meningkatkan penanaman modal swasta dalam membuat infrastruktur yang bersih, tindakan-tindakan yang melindungi penanam modal dan mekanisme-mekanisme penyelesaian perselisihan harus dipertimbangkan.
Sektor keuangan siap untuk memimpin perubahan ke arah keberlanjutan.
Saat Jerman mengambil alih kepresidenan G20 tahun depan, mereka akan memiliki kesempatan untuk meyakinkan mitra-mitranya untuk menciptakan kerangka yang baik untuk mendorong perubahan dalam sektor pembiayaan yang memastikan penyesuaian yang mulus menuju ekonomi karbon rendah.
Untuk para aktor swasta dan publik, sekaranglah saatnya bertindak.
Finance’s Crisis of Legitimacy
WASHINGTON, DC – The recent departure of Robert Diamond from Barclays marks a watershed.
To be sure, CEOs of major banks have been forced out before.
Chuck Prince lost his job at Citigroup over excessive risk-taking in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008, and, more recently, Oswald Grübel of UBS was pushed out for failing to prevent unauthorized trading to the tune of $2.3 billion.
But Diamond was a banker supposedly at the top of his game.
Barclays, it was claimed, had come through the 2008-2009 crisis without benefiting from government support.
And, while his bank had been found in violation of various rules recently, including on products sold to consumers and on how it reported interest rates, Diamond had managed to distance himself from the damage.
Press reports indicate that regulators were willing to give Diamond a free pass – right up to the moment when a serious political backlash took hold.
Diamond started to fight back, pointing an accusatory finger at the Bank of England.
At that point, he had to go.
There are three broader lessons of Diamond’s demise at Barclays.
First, the political backlash was not from backbenchers or uninformed spectators on the margins of the mainstream.
Top politicians from all parties in the United Kingdom were united in condemning Barclays’ actions, particularly with regard to its systemic cheating on the reporting of interest rates, exposed in the Libor scandal.
(The London Interbank Offered Rate is a key benchmark for borrowing and lending around the world, including for the pricing of derivatives).
Indeed, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne went so far as to say, “Fraud is a crime in ordinary business; why shouldn’t it be so in banking?”
His clear implication is that fraud was committed at Barclays – a serious allegation from Britain’s finance minister.
After five years of global financial-sector scandals on a grand scale, patience is wearing thin.
As Eduardo Porter of The New York Times put it,
“Bigger markets allow bigger frauds.
Bigger companies, with more complex balance sheets, have more places to hide them.
And banks, when they get big enough that no government will let them fail, have the biggest incentive of all.”
Second, Diamond apparently thought that he could take on the British establishment.
His staff leaked the contents of a conversation he claimed to have had with Paul Tucker, a senior Bank of England official, suggesting that the BoE had told Barclays to report inaccurate interest-rate numbers.
Diamond apparently forgot that the continued existence of any bank with a balance sheet that is large relative to its home economy – and its ability to earn a return for shareholders – depends entirely on maintaining a good relationship with regulators.
Barclays has total assets of around $2.5 trillion – roughly the size of the UK’s annual GDP – and is either the fifth- or eighth-largest bank in the world, depending on how one measures balance sheets.
Banks at this scale benefit from huge implicit government guarantees; this is what it means to be “too big to fail.”
Diamond apparently believed his own rhetoric – that he and his bank are critical to economic prosperity in the UK.
The regulators called his bluff and forced him to resign.
Barclays’ stock price rose slightly on the news.
The final lesson is that the big showdowns between democracy and big bankers are still to come – both in the United States and in continental Europe.
On the surface, the banks remain powerful, yet their legitimacy continues to crumble.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, presided this year over reckless risk-taking to the tune of nearly $6 billion (we might call it a “three Grübel” debacle), yet his job apparently remains secure.
Dimon even remains on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, despite the fact that the New York Fed is deeply involved in the investigation not only of JP Morgan Chase’s trading losses, but also of its potential involvement in the broadening Libor scandal.
As Dennis Kelleher, the president of the advocacy group Better Markets, documented in recent congressional testimony, two years after the passage of the Dodd-Frank legislation, the US banking system continues to fight hard – and effectively – to undermine meaningful reform.
(Kelleher’s testimony is a must-read assessment, as is his opening statement to the hearing).
But progress is nonetheless being made.
Dimon is the public face of megabanks’ resistance to reform; repeated and public egg on this particular face strengthens those who want to rein in these banks’ excessive and irresponsible risk-taking.
Meanwhile, the European situation looks explosive.
The European Union’s approach to bank regulation encouraged financial institutions to load up on government debt – supposedly a “risk-free” asset.
Now, given the profound sovereign-debt crisis in the eurozone periphery, government defaults threaten to take down the big banks.
The European Central Bank has provided a great deal of emergency “liquidity” funding to banks, which they use to buy even more government debt.
This holds down interest rates on that debt in the short run, but creates even bigger potential losses in the case of potential default.
Banks and politics are deeply intertwined in all advanced economies.
Diamond discovered that, ultimately, politicians trump bankers – at least in the UK.
But what really matters is legitimacy and informed public opinion.
Do you really believe the increasingly dubious notion that megabanks, as currently constituted, are good for the rest of the private sector, and thus for economic growth and job creation?
Or do you begin to consider more seriously the increasingly mainstream proposition that global megabanks and their leaders have simply become too powerful and dangerous?
The Varoufakis Effect?
ATHENS – In his end-of-2015 missive, Holger Schmieding of the Hamburg investment bank Berenberg warned his firm’s clients that what they should be worrying about now is political risk.
To illustrate, he posted the diagram below, showing how business confidence collapsed in Greece during the late spring of 2015, and picked up again only after my resignation from the finance ministry.
Schmieding chose to call this the “Varoufakis effect.”
There is no doubt that investors should be worried – very worried – about political risk nowadays, including the capacity of politicians and bureaucrats to do untold damage to an economy.
But they must also be wary of analysts who are either incapable of, or uninterested in, distinguishing between causality and correlation, and between insolvency and illiquidity.
In other words, they must be wary of analysts like Schmieding.
Business confidence in Greece did indeed plummet a few months after I became Finance Minister.
And it did pick up a month after my resignation.
The correlation is palpable.
But is the causality?
Consider the following example.
Business confidence fell in September 2001 (following the terror attacks on New York and Washington, DC), while Paul O’Neill was US Treasury Secretary.
Would Schmieding label a chart showing that decline the “O’Neill Effect”?
Of course not: the drop in business confidence had nothing to do with O’Neill and everything to do with fears about global security.
The correlation with O’Neill’s tenure was irrelevant.
Similarly, in the case of Greece, the collapse in business confidence happened under my watch.
But the cause was that our creditors, the so-called Troika (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund), made clear that they would close down our banking system to force our government to accept a fresh extend-and-pretend loan agreement.
Before these threats were issued, business confidence was actually picking up in Greece.
Indeed, the day after I presented my reform and fiscal proposals to the City of London investor community, stocks rallied impressively.
(Indeed, during my tenure in the finance ministry, real GDP grew more than it had done during the last two quarters of 2014, which Schmieding identifies as a period of increasing confidence.)
So, what caused the huge drop in business confidence during my tenure?
Was it my policy proposals – jointly authored with Jeff Sachs (with input from Norman Lamont, a former Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom, Harvard’s Larry Summers, and James K. Galbraith of the University of Texas) – that were responsible?
Or was it the Troika’s explicit threat of bank closures (which were actually imposed when we dared to put our creditors’ ultimatum to the Greek people in a referendum last July)?
In other words, was it the “Varoufakis effect” or the “Troika effect”?
To answer this question in ways that are helpful to investors, an analyst must at least make an effort to establish whether the observed correlation points to a causal link.
Reading our policy proposals and comparing them to the Troika’s program would have helped.
Unfortunately, this would have required work that some analysts prefer not to do.
The relevant question is whether we were right to confront the Troika – a central plank in our January 2015 electoral platform – or whether we should have signed up to our creditors’ “Greek program.”
My view is that we had no alternative but to resist the Troika’s plan.
The reason is simple: the Greek state became insolvent in early 2010.
From May 2010, this insolvency was addressed by means of sequential extend-and-pretend loans on conditions that were guaranteed to shrink national income, investment, and credit.
A case of insolvency was made increasingly worse by continuing to pretend that it was a mere liquidity problem.
Was the Greek economy on the mend in late 2014?
Of course not.
Nominal GDP never stopped shrinking, public and private debt continued to become less and less sustainable, and all along investment and credit remained comatose.
Without debt restructuring, a low target for the primary budget surplus (net of debt payments), a “bad bank” to deal with non-performing loans, and a comprehensive reform agenda that tackles the worst cases of rent seeking, Greece is condemned to permanent depression.
Alas, the Troika was in politically motivated denial and deeply uninterested in our policy proposals.
Time and again, they simply demanded capitulation.
To be sure, we could have handled that confrontation better.
But for an analyst to blame the victim of such financial violence is not only morally reprehensible, but also constitutes terrible service to his clients (who, for example, may be lulled into a false sense that Greece is on the mend now that Varoufakis has been forced out).
Thankfully, there are diligent analysts, like Mohamed El-Erian, to whom sensible investors can turn.
And their verdict is clear: Greece’s downturn in 2015 was due to the “Troika effect.”
Yes, political risk in Europe is clear and present.
But it emanates from the Troika’s unwillingness to reform itself and to rethink its failed policies.
Author’s postscript: Following the publication of this article, the pernicious “Troika effect” became even clearer when it was revealed that the chart Holger Schmieding used to demonstrate the “Varoufakis effect” was rather economical with the truth.
The original chart (published here) shows clearly that business confidence dove at the end of 2014, well before the Greek election and my appointment as Minister of Finance.
In Schmieding’s letter to his investors, the horizontal axis was stretched to show that business confidence fell well into 2015, once I was in office.
Nothing could better illustrate that investors have much to fear from analysts like Schmieding.
The Political Consequences of Financial Crises
LONDON – I may not be the only finance professor who, when setting essay topics for his or her students, has resorted to a question along the following lines: “In your view, was the global financial crisis caused primarily by too much government intervention in financial markets, or by too little?”
When confronted with this either/or question, my most recent class split three ways.
Roughly a third, mesmerized by the meretricious appeal of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, argued that governments were the original sinners.
Their ill-conceived interventions – notably the US-backed mortgage underwriters Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as the Community Reinvestment Act – distorted market incentives.
Some even embraced the argument of the US libertarian Ron Paul, blaming the very existence of the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort.
Another third, at the opposite end of the political spectrum, saw former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan as the villain.
It was Greenspan’s notorious reluctance to intervene in financial markets, even when leverage was growing dramatically and asset prices seemed to have lost touch with reality, that created the problem.
More broadly, Western governments, with their light-touch approach to regulation, allowed markets to career out of control in the early years of this century.
The remaining third tried to have it both ways, arguing that governments intervened too much in some areas, and too little in others.
Avoiding the question as put is not a sound test-taking strategy; but the students may have been onto something.
Now that the crisis is seven years behind us, how have governments and voters in Europe and North America answered this important question?
Have they shown, by their actions, that they think financial markets need tighter controls or that, on the contrary, the state should repudiate bailouts and leave financial firms to face the full consequences of their own mistakes?
From their rhetoric and regulatory policies, it would appear that most governments have ended up in the third, fence-sitting camp.
Yes, they have implemented a plethora of detailed controls, scrutinizing banks’ books with unprecedented intensity and insisting on approving cash distributions, the appointment of key directors, and even job descriptions for board members.
But they have ruled out any future government or central-bank support for ailing financial institutions.
Banks must now produce “living wills” showing how they can be wound down without the authorities’ support.
The government will wash its hands of them if they run into trouble: the era of “too big to fail” is over.
Perhaps this two-track approach was inevitable, though it would be good to know the desired end-point.
Is it a system in which market discipline again dominates, or will regulators sit on the shoulders of management for the foreseeable future?
But what have voters concluded?
In the first wave of post-crisis elections, the message was clear in one sense, and clouded in another.
Whichever government was in power when the crisis hit, whether left or right, was booted out and replaced by a government of the opposite political persuasion.
That was not universally true – see Germany’s Angela Merkel – but it certainly was true in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and elsewhere.
France moved from right to left, and the UK went from left to right.
But voters’ verdict on their governments was more or less identical: things went wrong on your watch, so out you go.
But now we can see a more consistent trend developing.
Three German economists, Manuel Funke, Moritz Schularik, and Christoph Trebesch, have just produced a fascinating assessment based on more than 800 elections in Western countries over the last 150 years, the results of which they mapped against 100 financial crises.
Their headline conclusion is stark: “politics takes a hard right turn following financial crises.
On average, far-right votes increase by about a third in the five years following systemic banking distress.”
The Great Depression of the 1930s, which followed the Wall Street crash of 1929, is the most obvious and worrying example that comes to mind, but the trend can be observed even in the Scandinavian countries, following banking crises there in the early 1990s.
So seeking to explain, say, the rise of the National Front in France in terms of President François Hollande’s personal and political unpopularity is not sensible.
There are greater forces at work than his exotic private life and inability to connect with voters.
The second major conclusion that Funke, Schularik, and Trebesch draw is that governing becomes harder after financial crises, for two reasons.
The rise of the far right lies alongside a political landscape that is typically fragmented, with more parties, and a lower share of the vote going to the governing party, whether of the left or the right.
So decisive legislative action becomes more challenging.
At the same time, a surge of extra-parliamentary mobilization occurs: more and longer strikes and more and larger demonstrations.
Control of the streets by government is not as secure.
The average number of anti-government demonstrations triples, the frequency of violent riots doubles, and general strikes increase by at least a third.
Greece has boosted those numbers recently.
The only comforting conclusion that the three economists reach is that these effects gradually peter out.
The data tell us that after five years, the worst is over.
That does not seem to be the way things are moving now in Europe, if we look at France’s recent election scare, not to mention Finland and Poland, where right-wing populists have now come to power.
Maybe the answer is that the clock starts ticking on the five years when the crisis is fully over, which is not yet true in Europe.
So politics seems set to remain a difficult trade for some time.
And the bankers and financiers who are widely blamed for the crisis will remain in the sin bin for a while yet, until voters’ expectations of economic and financial stability are more consistently satisfied.
Financial Crisis and War
PRINCETON – The approach of the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of World War I in 1914 has jolted politicians and commentators worried by the fragility of current global political and economic arrangements.
Indeed, Luxembourg’s prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, recently argued that Europe’s growing north-south polarization has set the continent back by a century.
The lessons of 1914 are about more than simply the dangers of national animosities.
The origins of the Great War include a fascinating precedent concerning how financial globalization can become the equivalent of a national arms race, thereby increasing the vulnerability of the international order.
In 1907, a major financial crisis emanating from the United States affected the rest of the world and demonstrated the fragility of the entire international financial system.
The response to the current financial crisis is replaying a similar dynamic.
Walter Bagehot’s 1873 classic Lombard Street described the City of London as “the greatest combination of economic power and economic delicacy that the world has ever seen.”
In one influential interpretation, popularized by the novelist, Labour Party MP, and future Nobel Peace Prize laureate Norman Angell in 1910, the interdependency of the increasingly complex global economy made war impossible.
But the opposite conclusion was equally plausible: Given the extent of fragility, a clever twist to the control levers might facilitate a military victory by the economic hegemon.
The aftermath of the 1907 crash drove the hegemonic power of the time – Great Britain – to reflect on how it could use its financial clout to enhance its overall strategic capacity.
That is the conclusion of an important recent book, Nicholas Lambert’s study of British economic planning and the First World War, entitled Planning Armageddon.
Lambert demonstrates how, in a grand strategic gamble, Britain began to marry its military – and especially naval – predominance and its global financial leadership.
Between 1905 and 1908, the British Admiralty developed the broad outlines of a plan for financial and economic warfare against Europe’s rising power, Germany.
Economic warfare, if implemented in full, would wreck Germany’s financial system and force it out of any military conflict.
When Britain’s naval visionaries confronted a rival in the form of the Kaiser’s Germany, they understood how power could thrive on financial fragility.
Pre-1914 Britain anticipated the private-public partnership that today links technology giants such as Google, Apple, or Verizon to US intelligence agencies.
London banks underwrote most of the world’s trade; Lloyds provided insurance for the world’s shipping.
These financial networks provided the information that enabled the British government to discover the sensitive strategic vulnerabilities of the opposing alliance.
For Britain’s rivals, the financial panic of 1907 demonstrated the necessity of mobilizing financial power themselves.
The US, for its part, recognized that it needed a central bank analogous to the Bank of England.
American financiers were persuaded that New York needed to develop its own commercial trading system to handle bills of exchange in the same way as the London market and arrange their monetization (or “acceptance”).
The central figure in pushing for the development of an American acceptance market was Paul Warburg, the immigrant younger brother of a great Hamburg banker who was the personal adviser to Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm II.
The Warburg brothers, Max and Paul, were a transatlantic tandem, energetically pushing for German-American institutions that would offer an alternative to British industrial and financial monopoly.
They were convinced that Germany and the US were growing stronger year by year, while British power would erode.
Some of the dynamics of the pre-1914 financial world are now reemerging.
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, financial institutions appear both as dangerous weapons of mass economic destruction, but also as potential instruments for the application of national power.
In managing the 2008 crisis, foreign banks’ dependence on US-dollar funding constituted a major weakness, and required the provision of large swap lines by the Federal Reserve.
Addressing that flaw requires renationalization of banking, and breaking up the activities of large financial institutions.
For European bankers, and some governments, current efforts by the US to revise its approach to the operation of foreign bank subsidiaries within its territory highlight that imperative.
They view the US move as a new sort of financial protectionism and are threatening retaliation.
Geopolitics is intruding into banking practice elsewhere as well.
Russian banks are trying to acquire assets in Central and Eastern Europe.
European banks are playing a much-reduced role in Asian trade finance.
Chinese banks are being pushed to expand their role in global commerce.
Many countries have begun to look at financial protectionism as a way to increase their political leverage.
The next step in this logic is to think about how financial power can be directed to national advantage in the case of a diplomatic conflict.
Sanctions are a routine (and not terribly successful) part of the pressure applied to rogue states like Iran and North Korea.
But financial pressure can be much more powerfully applied to countries that are deeply embedded in the global economy.
In 1907, in the wake of an epochal financial crisis that almost brought a complete global collapse, several countries started to think of finance primarily as an instrument of raw power that could and should be turned to national advantage.
That kind of thinking brought war in 1914.
A century later, in 2007-2008, the world experienced an even greater financial shock, and nationalistic passions have flared up in its wake.
Destructive strategies may not be far behind.
A Financial Early-Warning System
NEW YORK – Recent market volatility – in emerging and developed economies alike – is showing once again how badly ratings agencies and investors can err in assessing countries’ economic and financial vulnerabilities.
Ratings agencies wait too long to spot risks and downgrade countries, while investors behave like herds, often ignoring the build-up of risk for too long, before shifting gears abruptly and causing exaggerated market swings.
Given the nature of market turmoil, an early-warning system for financial tsunamis may be difficult to create; but the world needs one today more than ever.
Few people foresaw the subprime crisis of 2008, the risk of default in the eurozone, or the current turbulence in financial markets worldwide.
Fingers have been pointed at politicians, banks, and supranational institutions.
But ratings agencies and analysts who misjudged the repayment ability of debtors – including governments – have gotten off too lightly.
In principle, credit ratings are based on statistical models of past defaults; in practice, however, with few national defaults having actually occurred, sovereign ratings are often a subjective affair.
Analysts at ratings agencies follow developments in the country for which they are responsible and, when necessary, travel there to review the situation.
This process means that ratings are often backward-looking, downgrades occur too late, and countries are typically rerated based on when analysts visit, rather than when fundamentals change.
Moreover, ratings agencies lack the tools to track consistently vital factors such as changes in social inclusion, the country’s ability to innovate, and private-sector balance-sheet risk.
And yet sovereign ratings matter tremendously.
For many investors, credit ratings dictate where and how much they can invest.
Ratings affect how much banks are willing to lend, and how much developing countries – and their citizens – must pay to borrow.
They inform corporations’ decisions regarding whom to do business with, and on what terms.
Given the problems with ratings agencies, investors and regulators recognize the need for a different approach.
Investors have tried to identify good alternatives – and have largely failed.
Assessments of risk such as sovereign interest-rate spreads and credit default swaps react (and often over-react) fast; but, because they reflect only the market’s understanding of risk, they are not a systematic mechanism for uncovering hidden risks and avoiding crises.
Indeed, the recent sudden rise in market volatility suggests that they are as bad as rating agencies at detecting the early warning signs of trouble.
Regulators, meanwhile, are now starting to require banks to develop their own internal ratings processes.
The problem is that few institutions have the tools and expertise to do this alone.
A comprehensive assessment of a country’s macro investment risk requires looking systematically at the stocks and flows of the national account to capture all dangers, including risk in the financial system and the real economy, as well as wider risk issues.
As we have seen in recent crises, private risk taking and debt are socialized when a crisis occurs.
So, even when public deficits and debt are low before a crisis, they can rise sharply after one erupts.
Governments that looked fiscally sound suddenly appear insolvent.
Using 200 quantitative variables and factors to score 174 countries on a quarterly basis, we have identified a number of countries where investors are missing risks – and opportunities.
China is a perfect example.
The country’s home developers, local governments, and state-owned enterprises are severely over-indebted.
China has the balance-sheet strength to bail them out, but the authorities would then face a choice: embrace reform or rely once again on leverage to stimulate the economy.
Even if China continues on the latter course, it will fail to achieve its growth targets and will look more fragile over time.
Brazil should have been downgraded below investment grade last year, as the economy struggled with a widening fiscal deficit, a growing economy-wide debt burden, and a weak and worsening business environment.
The corruption scandal at energy giant Petrobras is finally causing ratings agencies to reassess Brazil, but the move comes too late, and their downgrades probably will not be sufficient to reflect the true risk.
Other emerging markets also look fragile and at risk of an eventual downgrade.
In the eurozone, shadow ratings already signaled red flags in the late 2000s in Greece and the other countries of the periphery.
More recently, Ireland and Spain may deserve to be upgraded, following fiscal consolidation and reforms.
Greece, however, remains a basket case.
Even with substantial reform to improve its growth potential, Greece will never be able to repay its sovereign debt and needs substantial relief.
An assessment of sovereign risk that is systematic and data-driven could help to spot the risks that changing global headwinds imply.
To that extent, it provides exactly what the world needs now: an approach that removes the need to rely on the ad hoc and slow-moving approach of ratings agencies and the noisy and volatile signals coming from markets.
Financial Hypocrisy
This year marks the tenth anniversary of the East Asia crisis, which began in Thailand on July 2, 1997, and spread to Indonesia in October and to Korea in December.
Eventually, it became a global financial crisis, embroiling Russia and Latin American countries, such as Brazil, and unleashing forces that played out over the ensuing years: Argentina in 2001 may be counted as among its victims.
There were many other innocent victims, including countries that had not even engaged in the international capital flows that were at the root of the crisis.
Indeed, Laos was among the worst-affected countries.
Though every crisis eventually ends, no one knew at the time how broad, deep, and long the ensuing recessions and depressions would be.
It was the worst global crisis since the Great Depression.
As the World Bank’s chief economist and senior vice president, I was in the middle of the conflagration and the debates about its causes and the appropriate policy responses.
This summer and fall, I revisited many of the affected countries, including Malaysia, Laos, Thailand, and Indonesia.
It is heartwarming to see their recovery.
These countries are now growing at 5% or 6% or more – not quite as fast as in the days of the East Asia miracle, but far more rapidly than many thought possible in the aftermath of the crisis.
Many countries changed their policies, but in directions markedly different from the reforms that the IMF had urged.
The poor were among those who bore the biggest burden of the crisis, as wages plummeted and unemployment soared.
As countries emerged, many placed a new emphasis on “harmony,” in an effort to redress the growing divide between rich and poor, urban and rural.
They gave greater weight to investments in people, launching innovative initiatives to bring health care and access to finance to more of their citizens, and creating social funds to help develop local communities.
Looking back at the crisis a decade later, we can see more clearly how wrong the diagnosis, prescription, and prognosis of the IMF and United States Treasury were.
The fundamental problem was premature capital market liberalization.
It is therefore ironic to see the US Treasury Secretary once again pushing for capital market liberalization in India – one of the two major developing countries (along with China) to emerge unscathed from the 1997 crisis.
It is no accident that these countries that had not fully liberalized their capital markets have done so well.
Subsequent research by the IMF has confirmed what every serious study had shown: capital market liberalization brings instability, but not necessarily growth.
(India and China have, by the same token, been the fastest-growing economies.)
Of course, Wall Street (whose interests the US Treasury represents) profits from capital market liberalization: they make money as capital flows in, as it flows out, and in the restructuring that occurs in the resulting havoc.
In South Korea, the IMF urged the sale of the country’s banks to American investors, even though Koreans had managed their own economy impressively for four decades, with higher growth, more stability, and without the systemic scandals that have marked US financial markets with such frequency.
In some cases, US firms bought the banks, held on to them until Korea recovered, and then resold them, reaping billions in capital gains.
In its rush to have westerners buy the banks, the IMF forgot one detail: to ensure that South Korea could recapture at least a fraction of those gains through taxation.

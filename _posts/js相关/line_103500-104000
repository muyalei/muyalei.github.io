Certainly not.
The country has been transformed profoundly in the recent decades.
Whether it is the breakup of public monopolies, such as electricity, gas, telecommunications, and even the post office, or the replacement of military conscription by a professional military, or pension reform, France has changed much more than is commonly believed.
This is particularly true with respect to French companies, which have remarkably adapted to the demands of international competition.
But much remains to be done: the entire educational system, up through the university level, requires serious reform, and many taboos regarding employment rules, social security, and the functioning of the state must be questioned.
What the experience with the CFE shows is not that reform is impossible, but that it cannot be unilaterally imposed.
Time must be taken for explanation, consultation, and negotiation.
In a society like France, marked by uncertainty about the future and in great need of having its self-confidence restored, the time taken to build consensus and create legitimacy for further reforms will certainly be well spent.
Is Free Trade With the US Right for Central America?
Ronald Reagan's death forced many people to confront once again the legacy of Central America's brutal wars in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua of two decades ago.
That the region's bloody history is truly behind it seems to have been confirmed by the recent signing of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) with the United States.
The symbolism of that treaty promises much, not least the idea that civil wars and US interventions may be things of the past.
But the details of the treaty offer little comfort to a region that is still recovering from the economic devastation wrought by those wars.
Paramount to CAFTA is a concern about the extent to which Central American countries will liberalize their economies.
But more critical is whether the agreement will make for healthier economies.
Although CAFTA represents an important opportunity in the region's quest to expand its access to the US market, it is unclear whether the new rules will strengthen or weaken Central American producers.
Under CAFTA, 80% of US exports will be duty-free as soon as the treaty is ratified, and all tariffs will expire in 15 years.
Until recently, the region maintained a trade surplus with the US, but with liberalization, the region will increase imports of more affordable goods, thereby turning the surplus into a deficit.
Consider Mexico's trade balance with the US since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect.
In the years between 1995 and 2002, Mexico's annual trade deficit with the US increased to $1 billion.
Moreover, trade in agricultural products will benefit US exporters more than Central American farmers.
The US, for example, agreed to sugar imports that equal 1% of the total US market.
That figure can grow only to 1.4% over the next 15 years.
At the same time, the agreement eliminates most import tariffs for commodities like rice, yellow corn, or dairy products.
This will force small and medium producers to become more competitive, but they must do so on an uneven playing field.
Unlike their counterparts in the US, Central American producers lack access to the capital and technology needed for them to expand and innovate.
So, instead of improving their competitiveness, the agreement is likely to increase the number of displaced workers and producers.
For a glimpse at the future, look at what has happened to Mexican corn farmers since NAFTA.
Central American textiles were also caught in a CAFTA snag.
The US textile lobby insisted that knit fabrics exported north come from Central America.
The trouble is that Central America relies on third countries for knit fabrics.
Finally, CAFTA fails to address labor issues in any significant way.
The agreement only stresses that labor rights are to be respected, highlighting that a party to the agreement "shall not fail to effectively enforce its labor laws, through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade between the Parties."
In a region with weak enforcement and few mechanisms for redress, protection restricted to prevailing labor standards amounts to no protection at all.
So why did Central America's leaders sign the agreement?
The region's economies have not experienced significant growth in the past five years (nor have they grown more than 5% annually in the past 20 years).
Desperate for improvement, its leaders had few choices and limited time to explore other options.
Instead of being creative, they have been inspired by a wave of neo-liberal nostrums that blinds them to other opportunities.
But there are alternatives.
Remittances by emigrants offer one of the richest.
Nearly $7 billion dollars has entered the region in remittances, yet there is no single economic policy that attempts to leverage the development potential of this gift.
Remittances normally grow more than 15% a year, and will continue to do so.
Even in a good year, trade with the US is unlikely to grow that much.
Central American leaders could implement limited banking reforms to offer incentives to emigrants to save remittances and invest in their home countries.
Instead, their attention is captivated solely by CAFTA's uncertain promises.
What lies ahead is uncertain; the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean stressed that CAFTA's implementation will add 0.5 percentage points to the rate of annual GDP growth in the region.
This is welcome news.
But the question is whether such growth will continue ten years from now or end up being a quick, but temporary, fix.
Regardless of its prospects, CAFTA is far from a done deal, and it at least opens the way for more discussion and debate.
Maybe the best news about CAFTA is that the US Congress is reluctant to take it on during an election year.
Is “Gene Doping” Wrong?
In recent years, the International Olympic Committee and other sports organizations have worried about the possible misuse of gene-transfer technology.
But the sports world seems intent on exploiting this technology in pursuit of gold medals and championships, and genetic testing may be the wave of the future.
Two Australian Football League teams have hinted that they are looking into tests that would indicate an athlete’s likely height, stamina, speed, and strength.
Indeed, for some, “gene doping” now represents the Holy Grail of performance enhancement, while for others it means the end of sports as we know it.
The prospect of a future of genetically modified athletes incites alarm throughout the sports world, accompanied by portrayals of such athletes as inhuman or some form of mutant.
This is a misrepresentation of how gene transfer would alter humans, both therapeutically and non-therapeutically, should it ever be legalized.
But the fear that rogue scientists will take advantage of athletes – or that athletes will seek to enroll in gene-transfer experiments in an attempt to receive some undetectable performance benefit – is very real.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibited gene doping in 2003, but some scientists predict that its misuse in sport is likely to appear at the Beijing 2008 Olympics.
It is in this context that the debate about gene doping erupted during the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
Unfortunately, because the discussion has so far been dominated by moral panic over the state of sports, many ethical considerations and important questions have been excluded.
Policies concerning gene doping should not rely solely on the interests and infrastructures of sports organizations.
In particular, the monitoring committees on genetic technology that nations develop must be taken on board by the world of sport.
A simple model based on prohibition and testing for gene modification will not be enough, assuming that detection is possible at all.
Moreover, ethics committees must be made aware of the special circumstances of sports, which limit the effectiveness of broader social policies on genetic modification.
Again, regulation ought not to rely on one single global authority.
As has been made clear from the ethical debates on stem-cell research, a global policy cannot easily be adopted or enforced, nor should it be.
Above all, it is not acceptable for the world of sport to impose a moral view about the role of enhancement technology on nations that wish to participate in the Olympics, without implementing an extensive and ongoing consultative process to accompany its policy decision.
This cannot involve the creation of working groups that merely pay lip service to ethical debate, but must enable non-sports organizations to develop their own policy framework for the regulation of ’gene doping’ and, more broadly, the use of genetic information.
Policies governing gene transfer in sports must, therefore, be recognized as subservient to broader bio-ethical and bio-legal interests that recognize the changing role of genetics in society.
The rhetoric surrounding “gene doping” relies heavily on its moral status as a form of cheating. Yet, this status relies on existing anti-doping rules.
If we don’t ban gene transfer in the first place, then on one level, it is not cheating.
In any case, to describe genetically modified athletes as mutants or inhuman is morally suspect, for it invokes the same kind of prejudice that we deplore in relation to other biological characteristics, particularly race, gender, and disability.
After all, many, if not most, top athletes are “naturally” genetically gifted.
To refer to these people as mutants would surely invite widespread criticism.
Those who fear that gene doping heralds the “end of sports” should instead recognize this moment as an opportunity to ask critical and difficult questions about the effectiveness and validity of anti-doping tests.
Does society really care about performance enhancement in sport?
That may sound like a radical question. But advancement in ethical inquiry relies on the conflict of beliefs and values.
For many years, commentators have expressed concerns about the culture of doping in elite sport. Yet, the culture of anti-doping is equally alarming, because it embodies a dogmatic commitment that limits the capacity for critical debate over what really matters in sport.
If anti-doping authorities truly care about sports, then they have a responsibility to re-examine the basic values that underpin their work.
They should begin by imagining what would happen if the child of a genetically modified human wanted to become an elite athlete.
At the very least, they might then be less prone to imposing the narrow moral position of the sports world on the parent.
Is Global Financial Reform Possible?
HONG KONG – Nowadays there is ample evidence that financial systems, whether in Asia in the 1990’s or a decade later in the United States and Europe, are vulnerable to breakdowns.
The cost in interrupted growth and unemployment has been intolerably large.
But, in the absence of international consensus on some key points, reform will be greatly weakened, if not aborted.
The freedom of money, financial markets, and people to move – and thus to escape regulation and taxation – might be an acceptable, even constructive, brake on excessive official intervention, but not if a deregulatory race to the bottom prevents adoption of needed ethical and prudential standards.
Perhaps most important is a coherent, consistent approach to dealing with the imminent failure of “systemically important” institutions.
Taxpayers and governments alike are tired of bailing out creditors for fear of the destructive contagious effects of failure –&nbsp;even as bailouts encourage excessive risk taking.
By law in the US, new approaches superseding established bankruptcy procedures dictate the demise rather than the rescue of failing firms, whether by sale, merger, or liquidation.
But such efforts’ success will depend on complementary approaches elsewhere, most importantly in the United Kingdom and other key financial centers.
Strict uniformity of regulatory practices may not be necessary.
For example, the UK and the US may be adopting approaches that differ with respect to protecting commercial banks from more speculative, proprietary trading, but the policy concerns are broadly similar – and may not be so pressing elsewhere, where banking traditions are different and trading is more restrained.
But other jurisdictions should not act to undercut the restrictions imposed by home authorities.
Closely related to these reforms is reform of the international monetary system.
Indeed, one might legitimately question whether we have a “system” at all, at least compared to the Bretton Woods arrangements and, before that, the seeming simplicity of the gold standard.
No one today has been able to exert authority systematically and consistently, and there is no officially sanctified and controlled international currency.
Arguably, the ideal of a well-defined and effective international monetary regime has become more difficult to realize as markets and capital flows have become vastly larger and more capricious.
Indeed, the global economy, it is said, has grown – and emerging countries have flourished – without a more organized system.
But what is too often overlooked is that international monetary disorder lay at the root of the successive financial crises of the 1990’s, and played an even more striking role in the crisis that erupted in 2008.
The sustained and, in a sense, complementary imbalances in the US and Asia stand out.
From 2000 to 2007, the US ran a cumulative current-account deficit of roughly $5.5 trillion, with nearly symmetrical offsetting increases in reserves in China and Japan.
China found it useful to run a large trade surplus, using a very high rate of internal savings and inward foreign investment to support its industrialization and rapid growth.
By contrast, the US, in the face of slow growth, was content to sustain exceptionally high levels of consumption at the expense of personal savings, inflating a massive housing bubble that burst with a very large and deeply disturbing bang.
The practical and inescapable lesson is that when any country is left to its own policy devices, its preferences may lead to prolonged and ultimately unsustainable imbalances.
Sooner or later, adjustment will be necessary – if not by considered domestic policy or a well-functioning international monetary system, then by financial crisis.
Not so long ago, we were comforted by theorizing that floating exchange rates would mediate international adjustments in a timely and orderly way.
But, in the real world, many countries, particularly but not limited to small, open economies, simply find it impractical or undesirable to permit their currency to float.
We are left with the certainty, however awkward, that active participation in an open world economy requires some surrender of economic sovereignty.
Or, to put the point more positively, it requires a willingness to coordinate policies more effectively.
The possibilities include:
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stronger surveillance by the International Monetary Fund and a firmer commitment by countries to abide by “best practices” and agreed norms.
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct and public recommendations by the IMF, the G-20, or others, following mandatory consultation.
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualification or disqualification with respect to the use of IMF or other credit facilities (for example, central banks’ swap lines).
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interest or other financial penalties or incentives along the lines under consideration in Europe.
But, if approaches that build on past failure do not seem sufficiently effective, perhaps a new approach toward currency fluctuations would be more promising.
That would require some agreement about appropriate “equilibrium” exchange rates, with a fairly wide band that would allow for uncertainty and permit the market to exert its own discipline.
But individual countries would orient intervention and economic policies toward defending the equilibrium rate, or, more radically, an international authority might authorize aggressive intervention by trading partners to promote consistency.
An appropriate reserve currency and adequate international liquidity represent another central concern.
For years, the pragmatic answer has been the dollar, and to some extent other national currencies, giving rise to complaints of an “inordinate privilege” for the US.
But it is not in America’s interest to accentuate and extend its payment deficits at the expense of an internationally competitive economy with strong industry and restrained consumption.
And the rest of the world wants the flexibility afforded by the currency of the largest, strongest, and most stable economy.
A useful reserve currency must be limited in supply, but have sufficient elasticity to satisfy the large, unpredictable needs that may arise in a turbulent financial world.
Above all, confidence in its stability and availability must be maintained, which highlights the practicality of a national currency, or perhaps a variety of national currencies.
Is Gordon Brown Electable?
Gordon Brown obviously wants to succeed Tony Blair as British prime minister. But it is less obvious that he is willing to do what is necessary to lead the Labour Party to victory in the next general election.
In some critical sense, he must repudiate Blair’s legacy, which, at a minimum, means promising to take Britain out of the Iraq War.
Brown has longed to be prime minister ever since May 12, 1994, the fateful day when John Smith, the Labour Party’s leader in opposition, dropped dead of a heart attack.
Two weeks later, on May 31, Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London, and debated who should take over the party leadership.
By the end of their discussion, they had made a double deal: Brown would stand aside and support Blair as the next party leader; in return, Blair would later give up the leadership to him.
Crucially, but inevitably, they did not agree when, or under what circumstances, Blair would fulfil his side of the bargain.
Inevitably, they could not foresee that Blair would go on to win an unprecedented three successive election victories for Labour, in 1997, 2001, and 2005, and thus keep Labour in power for a record-breaking period of possibly as long as 13 years.
The key challenge for New Labour (as Blair re-styled it with his characteristic gift for spin), was the management of the British economy.
Since World War II, most British governments tried to manipulate the economy for short-term party advantage, usually with disastrous long-term results.
This lamentable tradition was common to both Conservatives and Labour; and yet, unfairly, it was the Labour Party that was most contaminated by the smear that it could not be trusted to manage the economy.
Brown decisively changed that reputation.
He has been probably the most outstanding Chancellor of the Exchequer in British history, not because of any inspiration or genius, but simply because he has built on a new tradition of prioritizing low inflation, low interest rates, and stable government finances.
Brown understood that these priorities were essential, not just for the British economy, but also for the long-term prospects of Labour in power; and he entrenched this agenda by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility for keeping inflation low.
As a result, Britain has had an unprecedented decade of low inflation and relatively high economic growth, outperforming many of its European counterparts.
Yet, despite economic success, it became steadily clearer that Blair’s time was running out.
The electorate grew increasingly disillusioned with the unavoidable shortcomings of an over-familiar government, and the party grew increasingly discontented with a leader who had outstayed his welcome.
At first, Blair thought that he could claim the right to remain in power for a third full five-year term. But the pressure on him to go has steadily risen, to the point where he has now almost promised to give up in the summer of 2007.
But no one knows exactly when, or how, Blair will step down.
If there is a formal leadership contest, it seems likely that several rival candidates will aim to stand.
But almost all authoritative observers seem to agree that Brown is by far the most likely man to be the next Labour prime minister.
That is the easy part.
From that point on, no one seems certain whether Brown knows what to do, or has what it takes, to fight and win another general election for Labour.
His reputation for command and control of the economy is magisterial and unchallenged, but he has given almost no clue as to what he thinks of other government policies.
He has remained dour and almost silent, visibly chafing with impatience to come into his inheritance, but offering no hint of what difference he would make when he does.
The one thing he cannot do is promises to continue Blair’s policies.
If Brown offers more of the same, he will lose.
After ten years of Blair, he must offer one or more policies that mark a clear break.
The most obvious candidate for such a policy switch is Iraq: if Brown wants to win an election as Labour leader, he must renounce Blair’s policy and announce the withdrawal, in short order, of British troops.
In tactical terms, this should be easy and obvious: whatever the deceitful and illegal reasons originally given for invading Iraq, everyone now knows that this war has proved a political, strategic, and moral catastrophe.
Everyone knows that it cannot be “won,” whatever that means, and Brown knows that both the war and Britain’s servile subordination to the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in Britain.
This is the issue that is crying out to be addressed: but so far none of the main political parties has dared touch it.
In the past three weeks, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives have all held their annual conferences.
All of them concentrated on domestic policies; none dared discuss Iraq, because they all know that to do so would raise the question of withdrawal, which in turn would unleash a major and possibly explosive debate about Britain’s relationship with the US.
Does Brown have the stomach to take on the risks involved in confronting the Iraq question?
Possibly not.
He may decide that it is too difficult, in which case he will be a lame duck prime minister, condemned to serve out the three years remaining in Labour’s current term with no hope of winning the next election.
That is not what he planned when he struck his bargain with Blair back in 1994.
Is Greece Japan’s Future?
TOKYO – The Greek fiscal crisis has sent shockwaves through markets around the world.
In just two years, Greece’s budget deficit jumped from 4% of GDP to 13%.
Now other European Union countries seem under threat, and the EU and the International Monetary Fund are grappling to stem the crisis before another nation trembles.
But the problem of excessive government debt is not confined to the EU.
Indeed, Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is around 170% – much higher than in Greece, where the figure stands at around 110%.
But, despite the grim parallel, Japan’s government does not seem to think that it needs to take the problem seriously.
Last year’s general election brought regime change to Japan. Yukio Hatoyama’s Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) thrashed the Liberal Democratic Party, which had governed almost continuously for a half-century.
But Hatoyama’s government has ignored macroeconomic management by abolishing the policy board charged with discussing economic and fiscal policy.
Instead, the government has focused on increasing spending to meet its grand electoral promises, including a huge amount for new grants to households and farmers.
As a result, the ratio of tax revenue to total spending this fiscal year has fallen below 50% for the first time in Japan’s postwar history.
If the government continues on this path, many expect next year’s budget deficit to widen further.
Despite the weakness of Japan’s fiscal position, the market for Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) remains stable, at least for now.
Japan had a similar experience in the 1990’s, the country’s so-called “lost decade.” At that time, Japan’s budget deficit soared after the country’s property bubble burst, causing economic stagnation.
But JGBs are mostly purchased by domestic organizations and households.
In other words, the private sector’s huge savings financed the government’s deficit, so that capital flight never occurred in the way it has in Greece, despite the desperate budget situation.
But this situation has deteriorated recently, for two reasons. First, the total volume of JGBs has become extremely high relative to households’ net monetary assets, which stand at roughly ¥1,100 trillion.
But in a mere three years, total JGBs will exceed this total. This suggests that taxpayer assets will no longer back government debt, at which point confidence in the JGB market is likely to shatter.
Second, Japanese society is aging – fast.
As a result, the country’s household savings rate will decrease dramatically, making it increasingly difficult for the private sector to finance budget deficits.
Moreover, an aging population implies further pressure on fiscal expenditure, owing to higher pension and health-care costs, with all of Japan’s baby boomers set to reach age 65 in about five years.
The increase in social-welfare costs is expected to start around 2013, three years from now.
Given these factors, the JGB market, which has been stable so far, will face serious trouble in the years ahead.
After averting its eyes since coming to power, Japan’s new government has finally started discussing tax hikes.
One possibility is an increase in the consumption tax, which currently stands at 5% – low in comparison with other industrialized countries.
But tax hikes alone with not close Japan’s fiscal black hole.
What is most needed is consistent and stable macroeconomic management.
Such management is possible.
Between 2001and 2006, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi aggressively tackled Japan’s fiscal problems.
Koizumi sought smaller government and set clear numerical targets for fiscal consolidation, including a primary budget balance in 10 years.
Surprisingly, Koizumi was almost successful.
Japan’s primary deficit of ¥28 trillion in 2002 was reduced to only ¥6 trillion by 2007.
If this effort had been continued for two more years, a primary budget surplus could have been realized.
But over the past three years, the prime minister changed each year, and a populist trend in fiscal expenditure took hold.
What is needed most now is for the DPJ government to restore comprehensive economic management.
A tax hike is only part of that. Without a strategy for growth, an effort to reduce government spending, and a policy to stop deflation, a tax hike will not solve the problem.
Indeed, some economists fear that a fiscal crisis could erupt even aftera tax hike is passed.
Once that happens, the impact on neighboring countries – and on the world economy – will be huge compared to the current European problem.
After all, Japan remains the world’s second largest economy, accounting for about one-third of Asia’s GDP, and 8% of global output, whereas the GDP share of Greece in the EU is about 3%.
In some countries, lower military expenditures and interest rates has helped to improve a weak fiscal position.
But in the case of Japan, military spending is already low, as are interest rates.
This suggests that fiscal rescue will be extremely difficult if and when trouble starts – and underscores the urgent need for real political leadership now.
Is Ignorance Bliss?
The age of the Renaissance man is long gone.
No one thinks it is possible anymore for an individual to grasp, fully, all areas of science and technology.
Popular software contains millions of lines of code.
Mechanisms of the immune response for just one kind of lymphocyte take up thousands of pages of scholarly journals.
An iPod's elegantly simple appearance masks underlying technology that is understood by only a tiny percentage of its users.
But, despite the vast incompleteness of our knowledge, recent research suggests that most people think that they know far more than they actually do.
We freely admit to not knowing everything about how a helicopter flies or a printing press prints, but we are not nearly modest enough about our ignorance.
The easiest way to show this is to have people to rate the completeness of their knowledge on a seven-point scale.
For any question, a “7” denotes the equivalent of a perfectly detailed mental blueprint, and a “1” implies almost no sense of a particular mechanism at all, just a vague image.
People happily, and reliably, assign numbers to their understandings of everything from complex machines to biological systems to natural phenomena such as the tides; but these ratings are usually far higher than their actual knowledge.
We can measure the discrepancy between what we think we know and what we actually know by simply asking people, after they have given their initial ratings, to tell us how some things work in as much detail as they can and then to rate their knowledge again in light of their attempt to explain.
Similarly, we can ask them to answer critical diagnostic questions (for example, “How does a helicopter go from hovering in place to flying forward?”)
Or we can simply provide them with a concise but meaty expert explanation.
In all of these cases, people somewhat sheepishly confess that their level of understanding was far worse than they originally thought.
People are often surprised and dismayed at their ignorance, but we are not generally bad at estimating how much we know.
Instead, we have a special deficit with regard to our explanatory understandings.
We are good at estimating how well we know simple facts (such as the capitals of countries), procedures (such as how to make an international phone call), and narratives (such as the plots of well-known movies).
But we seem to have a specific “illusion of explanatory depth” – the belief that we possess a more profound causal understanding than we really do.
We can be appropriately modest about our knowledge of other things, but not so about our ability to explain the workings of the world.
Several factors converge to create this illusion of knowledge.
When Leon Rozenblit and I uncovered the illusion and its specificity, we ran an extensive series of studies exploring why explanatory understanding is so vulnerable to a false sense of knowing.
All of the factors that we identified are less influential for facts, procedures, and narratives.
One important factor underlying the illusion of explanatory depth arises from the richly hierarchical nature of most complex systems, which means that they can be understood at several levels of analysis.
One can understand how a computer “works” in terms of the high-level functions of the mouse, the hard drive, and the display while not having any understanding of the mechanisms that enable a cursor to move when a mouse is moved, or allow information to be stored and erased, or control pixels on a screen.
This hierarchical structure of complex causal systems seduces us into a sense of understanding at a high level, which is then mistaken for having an understanding at a lower level.
A second factor is the false comfort we derive from seeing the parts of a system.
The more parts you can see, the more you think you know how those parts actually work.
Thus, the illusion is stronger for objects with easy-to-inspect parts than it is for objects with more invisible, inaccessible, or microscopic parts.
For example, we may think that we understand the mind much better than we do when we see images of glowing brain regions.
Finally, we often figure out things on the fly when they are in front of us, but then falsely assume that we came to the object with a full understanding in our heads rather than using and manipulating the object to decipher its mechanism.
There may be a silver lining to our inflated sense of understanding.
The world is, of course, far too complex for any lone person to fully grasp.
If a gnawing sense of ignorance kept us diving deeper in our quest to understand everything we encountered, we might suffocate in the details in one area and miss other areas completely.
The illusion of explanatory depth may stop us at just about the right level of understanding, one that enables us to know how to get more information from others when we really need it without being overwhelmed.
It would perhaps be better if we recognized the limits our own explanatory ability, but there may be some adaptive value of those limits as well.
Is Inequality Inhibiting Growth?
CHICAGO – To understand how to achieve a sustained recovery from the Great Recession, we need to understand its causes.
And identifying causes means starting with the evidence.
Two facts stand out.
First, overall demand for goods and services is much weaker, both in Europe and the United States, than it was in the go-go years before the recession.
Second, most of the economic gains in the US in recent years have gone to the rich, while the middle class has fallen behind in relative terms.
In Europe, concerns about domestic income inequality, though more muted, are compounded by angst about inequality between countries, as Germany roars ahead while the southern periphery stalls.
Persuasive explanations of the crisis point to linkages between today’s tepid demand and rising income inequality.
Progressive economists argue that the weakening of unions in the US, together with tax policies favoring the rich, slowed middle-class income growth, while traditional transfer programs were cut back.
With incomes stagnant, households were encouraged to borrow, especially against home equity, to maintain consumption.
Rising house prices gave people the illusion that increasing wealth backed their borrowing.
But, now that house prices have collapsed and credit is unavailable to underwater households, demand has plummeted.
The key to recovery, then, is to tax the rich, increase transfers, and restore worker incomes by enhancing union bargaining power and raising minimum wages.
This emphasis on anti-worker, pro-rich policies as the recession’s primary cause fits less well with events in Europe.
Countries like Germany that reformed labor laws to create more flexibility for employers, and did not raise wages rapidly, seem to be in better economic shape than countries like France and Spain, where labor was better protected.
So consider an alternative explanation: Starting in the early 1970’s, advanced economies found it increasingly difficult to grow.
Countries like the US and the United Kingdom eventually responded by deregulating their economies.
Greater competition and the adoption of new technologies increased the demand for, and incomes of, highly skilled, talented, and educated workers doing non-routine jobs like consulting.
More routine, once well-paying, jobs done by the unskilled or the moderately educated were automated or outsourced.
So income inequality emerged, not primarily because of policies favoring the rich, but because the liberalized economy favored those equipped to take advantage of it.
The short-sighted political response to the anxieties of those falling behind was to ease their access to credit.
Faced with little regulatory restraint, banks overdosed on risky loans.
Thus, while differing on the root causes of inequality (at least in the US), the progressive and alternative narratives agree about its consequences.
The alternative narrative has more to say.
Continental Europe did not deregulate as much, and preferred to seek growth in greater economic integration.
But the price for protecting workers and firms was slower growth and higher unemployment.
And, while inequality did not increase as much as in the US, job prospects were terrible for the young and unemployed, who were left out of the protected system.
The advent of the euro was a seeming boon, because it reduced borrowing costs and allowed countries to create jobs through debt-financed spending.
The crisis ended that spending, whether by national governments (Greece), local governments (Spain), the construction sector (Ireland and Spain), or the financial sector (Ireland).
Unfortunately, past spending pushed up wages, without a commensurate increase in productivity, leaving the heavy spenders indebted and uncompetitive.
The important exception to this pattern is Germany, which was accustomed to low borrowing costs even before it entered the eurozone.
Germany had to contend with historically high unemployment, stemming from reunification with a sick East Germany.
In the euro’s initial years, Germany had no option but to reduce worker protections, limit wage increases, and reduce pensions as it tried to increase employment.
Germany’s labor costs fell relative to the rest of the eurozone, and its exports and GDP growth exploded.
The alternative view suggests different remedies.
The US should focus on helping to tailor the education and skills of the people being left behind to the available jobs.
This will not be easy or quick, but it beats having corrosively high levels of inequality of opportunity, as well as a large segment of the population dependent on transfers.
Rather than paying for any necessary spending by raising tax rates on the rich sky high, which would hurt entrepreneurship, more thoughtful across-the-board tax reform is needed.
For the uncompetitive parts of the eurozone, structural reforms can no longer be postponed.
But, given the large adjustment needs, it is not politically feasible to do everything, including painful fiscal tightening, immediately.
Less austerity, while not a sustainable growth strategy, may ease the pain of adjustment.
That, in a nutshell, is the fundamental eurozone dilemma: the periphery needs financing as it adjusts, while Germany, pointing to the post-euro experience, says that it cannot trust countries to reform once they get the money.
The Germans have been insisting on institutional change – more centralized eurozone control over periphery banks and government budgets in exchange for expanded access to financing for the periphery.
Yet institutional change, despite the euphoria that greeted the latest EU summit, will take time, for it requires careful structuring and broader public support.
Europe may be better off with stop-gap measures.
If confidence in Italy or Spain deteriorates again, the eurozone may have to resort to the traditional bridge between weak credibility and low-cost financing: a temporary International Monetary Fund-style monitored reform program.
Such programs cannot dispense with the need for government resolve, as Greece’s travails demonstrate.
And governments hate the implied loss of sovereignty and face.
But determined governments, like those of Brazil and India, have negotiated programs in the past that set them on the path to sustained growth.
As a reformed Europe starts growing, parts of it may experience US-style inequality.
But growth can provide the resources to address that.
Far worse for Europe would be to avoid serious reform and lapse into egalitarian and genteel decline.
Japan, not the US, is the example to avoid.
Is Inflation Returning?
CAMBRIDGE – Inflation is now low in every industrial country, and the combination of high unemployment and slow GDP growth removes the usual sources of upward pressure on prices.
Nevertheless, financial investors are increasingly worried that inflation will eventually begin to rise, owing to the large expansion of commercial bank reserves engineered by the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB).
Some investors, at least, remember that rising inflation typically follows monetary expansion, and they fear that this time will be no different.
Investors have responded to these fears by buying gold, agricultural land, and other traditional inflation hedges.
The price of gold recently reached a four-month high and is approaching $1,700 an ounce.
Prices per acre of farmland in Iowa and Illinois rose more than 10% over the past year.
And the recent release of the US Federal Reserve Board’s minutes, which indicate support for another round of quantitative easing, caused sharp jumps in the prices of gold, silver, platinum, and other metals.
But, unlike private investors, Fed officials insist that this time really will be different.
They note that the enormous expansion of commercial banks’ reserves has not led to a comparable increase in the supply of money and credit.
While reserves increased at an annual rate of 22% over the past three years, the broad monetary aggregate (M2) that most closely tracks nominal GDP and inflation over long periods of time increased at less than 6% over the same three years.
In past decades, large expansions of bank reserves caused lending surges that increased the money supply and fueled inflationary spending growth.
But now commercial banks are willing to hold their excess reserves at the Fed, because the Fed now pays interest on those deposits.
The ECB also pays interest on deposits, so it, too, can in principle prevent higher reserves from leading to an unwanted lending explosion.
The Fed’s ability to pay interest is the key to what it calls its “exit strategy” from previous quantitative easing.
When the economic recovery begins to accelerate, commercial banks will want to use the large volume of reserves that the Fed has created to make loans to businesses and consumers.
If credit expands too rapidly, the Fed can raise the interest rate that it pays on deposits.
Sufficiently high rates will induce commercial banks to prefer the Fed’s combination of liquidity, safety, and yield to expanding the quantity of private lending.
That, at any rate, is the theory; no one knows how it would work in practice.
How high would the Fed – or the ECB, for that matter – have to raise the interest rate on deposits to prevent excessive growth in bank lending?
What if that interest rate had to be 4% or 6% or even 8%?
Would the Fed or the ECB push its deposit rate that high, or would it allow a rapid, potentially inflationary lending growth?
The unusual nature of current unemployment increases the risk of future inflation still further.
Nearly half of the unemployed in the US, for example, have now been out of work for six months or longer, up from the traditional median unemployment duration of just 10 weeks.
The long-term unemployed will be much slower to be hired as the economy recovers than those who have been out of work for a much shorter period of time.
The risk, therefore, is that product markets will tighten while there is still high measured unemployment.
Inflation will begin in product markets, rather than in the labor market.
Businesses will want to borrow, and banks will want to expand their lending.
Under these conditions, the Fed will want to raise the interest rate to prevent an acceleration of inflation.
But, if the unemployment rate is then still relatively high – say, above 7% – some members of the Fed’s Open Market Committee may argue that the Fed’s dual mandate – low unemployment as well as low inflation – implies that it is too soon to raise interest rates.
There could also be strong pressure from the US Congress not to raise interest rates.
Although the Fed’s legal “independence” means that the White House cannot tell the Fed what to do, the Fed is fully accountable to Congress.
The recent Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation took away some of the Fed’s powers, and the legislative debate surrounding the bill indicated that there could be wide support for further restrictions if Congress becomes unhappy with Fed policy.
Politicians’ desire to keep interest rates low in order to reduce unemployment is often in tension with the Fed’s concern to act in a timely manner to maintain price stability.
The large number of long-term unemployed may make the problem more difficult this time by causing the unemployment rate to remain high even when product markets are beginning to experience rising inflation.
If that happens, Fed officials will face a difficult choice: tighten monetary policy to stem accelerating price growth, thereby antagonizing Congress and possibly facing restrictions that make it difficult to fight inflation in the future; or do nothing.
Either choice could mean a higher future rate of inflation, just as financial markets fear.
Although the ECB does not have to deal with direct legislative oversight, it is now clear that there are members of its governing board who would oppose higher interest rates, and that there is political pressure from government leaders and finance ministers to keep rates low.
Rising inflation is certainly not inevitable, but, in both the US and Europe, it has become a risk to be reckoned with.
Is Inflation the Answer?
CHICAGO – Recently, a number of commentators have proposed a sharp, contained bout of inflation as a way to reduce debt and reenergize growth in the United States and the rest of the industrial world.
Are they right?
To understand this prescription, we have to comprehend the diagnosis.
As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff argue, recoveries from crises that result from over-leveraged balance sheets are slow and typically resistant to traditional macroeconomic stimulus.
Over-levered households cannot spend, over-levered banks cannot lend, and over-levered governments cannot stimulate.
So, the prescription goes, why not generate higher inflation for a while?
This will surprise fixed-income investors who agreed in the past to lend long term at low rates, bring down the real value of debt, and eliminate debt “overhang,” thereby re-starting growth.
It is an attractive solution at first glance, but a closer look suggests cause for serious concern.
Start with the question of whether central banks that have spent decades establishing and maintaining anti-inflation credibility can generate faster price growth in an environment of low interest rates.
Japan tried – and failed: banks were too willing to hold the reserves that the central bank released as it bought back bonds.
Perhaps if a central bank announced a higher inflation target, and implemented a financial-asset purchase program (financed with unremunerated reserves) until the target were achieved, it could have some effect.
But it is more likely that the concept of a target would lose credibility once it became changeable.
Market participants might conjecture that the program would be abandoned once it reached an alarming size – and well before the target was achieved.
Moreover, the central bank needs rapid, sizeable inflation to bring down real debt values quickly – a slow increase in inflation (especially if well signaled by the central bank) would have limited effect, because maturing debt would demand not only higher nominal rates, but also an inflation-risk premium to roll over claims.
Significant inflation might be hard to contain, however, especially if the central bank loses credibility: Would the public really believe that the central bank is willing to push interest rates sky high and kill growth in order to contain inflation, after it abandoned its earlier inflation target in order to foster growth?
Consider, next, whether the inflationary cure would work as advertised.
Inflation would do little for entities with floating-rate liabilities (including the many households that borrowed towards the peak of the boom and are most underwater) or relatively short-term liabilities (banks).
Even the US government, with debt duration of about four years, would be unlikely to benefit much from an inflation surprise, unless it were huge.
Meanwhile, the bulk of its obligations are social security and health care, which cannot be inflated away.
Even for distressed households that have borrowed long term, the effects of higher inflation are uncertain.
What would help is if their nominal disposable income rose relative to their (fixed) debt service.
Yet, with high levels of unemployment likely to keep nominal wage growth relatively subdued, typical troubled households could be worse off – with higher food and fuel prices cutting into disposable income.
Of course, any windfall to borrowers has to come from someone else’s wealth.
Inflation would clearly make creditors worse off.
Who are they?
Some are rich people, but they also include pensioners who moved into bonds as the stock market scared them away; banks that would have to be recapitalized; state pension funds that are already in the red; and insurance companies that would have to default on their claims.
In the best of all worlds, it would be foreigners with ample reserves who suffer the losses, but those investors might be needed to finance future deficits.
So central banks would have to regain anti-inflation credibility very soon after subjecting investors to a punishing inflation.
In such a world, investors would have to be far more trusting than they are in this one.
This does not mean that nothing can be done about the debt problem.
The US experienced debt crises periodically during the nineteenth century, and again during the Great Depression.
Its response was to offer targeted and expedited debt relief – often by bringing in new temporary bankruptcy legislation that forced limited debt write-downs.
In this vein, a recent proposal by Eric Posner and Luigi Zingales to facilitate mortgage-debt renegotiation would give a deeply underwater homeowner the right to file a pre-packaged Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.
This would allow her to write down the value of her mortgage by the average house-price depreciation in her postal zone since the borrowing date, in exchange for giving the lender a share of the future house-price appreciation.
A bankruptcy judge would approve the petition, provided the court was satisfied that the homeowner could make the reduced payments.
Such automatic borrower-initiated filings, if made legal by Congress, could reduce the household-debt overhang without the need for government subsidies.
To the extent that the alternative is costly foreclosure proceedings that make borrowers and lenders worse off, this proposal should attract the support of both sides.
No solution is without weaknesses, though.
One reason that banks oppose debt write-downs is that many underwater homeowners continue to repay debt rather than default, even while cutting back on other spending.
If these diligent payers are eventually expected to default, writing down their debt today makes sense.
If they are expected to muddle through, a blanket debt write-down would weaken banks and might slow economic growth.
Policymakers espousing debt write-downs to spur growth should ask whether they have the political support to recapitalize banks if needed.
Prescriptions like these – as with those for a jolt of inflation – have gained ground because the obvious solutions to economic stagnation have been tried and failed.
But, as the proposals become more innovative and exotic, we must examine them carefully to ensure that they wouldn’t end up making matters worse.
Is Iraq Safe Yet?
WASHINGTON, DC – The Obama administration’s decision to withdraw the bulk of United Sates troops from Iraq over the next 19 months has sparked fears that Iraq will once again plunge into the wide-scale and debilitating violence that it endured from 2004 to 2007.
Those fears are, for the most part, overblown.
There are good reasons to believe that the level of stability achieved in Iraq can be maintained even without a large-scale US presence.
To understand why, it is important to know what else was going on inside Iraq in 2007, when President George W. Bush ordered the “surge” of 20,000 additional troops and General David H. Petraeus shifted US forces to a more aggressive strategy.
For, although the surge was important, two other factors played a critical role in bringing Iraq back from the brink.
First, Baghdad had been transformed into a Shiite-dominated city.
Although exact statistics are hard to come by, in 2003 approximately 35% of Baghdad’s population was Sunni.
Today, based upon the results of the recently held regional election, Baghdad is only 10% to 15% Sunni.
This means that between one million and 1.5 million Sunnis have fled the capital.
Most now are refugees in Jordan and Syria, and they are unlikely to be welcomed home anytime soon by the new Shiite elite running the country.
The ethnic cleansing of many Baghdad neighborhoods in 2006 and 2007 was deplorable.
But it made it difficult for Sunni insurgents to hide or blend in with the population, and deprived them of logistical and financial support.�It also provided a degree of safety and security for the Shiite-led government, which was largely the purpose of the well-organized campaign in the first place.
The second critical factor in stabilizing Iraq was its regional neighbors’ recognition of, and in some cases support for, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s government.
This was a major change from the 2003-2005 period, when Iraq’s Sunni neighbors, fearing the country’s new Shiite elite, actively opposed the US occupation.
The multiple insurgencies that developed in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 were supported at least in part by money, materiel, and fighters from abroad.�Suicide bombers from all over the Arab world crossed into the country through the porous Syrian and Jordanian borders.
Regional governments may not have openly supported the insurgents, but they clearly avoided cracking down on the jihadist groups operating within their borders.
Foreign governments began to change these polities after al-Qaeda in Iraq bombed three hotels in Amman, Jordan, in November 2005, killing 60 people.
Frightened governments in the region realized that the type of violence occurring almost daily in Iraq was starting to spill across the country’s borders.
Soon after this incident, the highly effective Jordanian intelligence service began assisting the Iraqi government in going after the al-Qaeda network in Iraq.
By June 2006, this effort was paying off.
Jordanian agents were instrumental in providing the intelligence that enabled US forces to kill Abu Zarqawi, the mastermind of the Amman bombing.
Slowly but surely, throughout 2006 and 2007, Jordanian intelligence, working with Iraqi Sunni tribes, chipped away at al-Qaeda.
Moreover, quiet efforts were made in the Arab world to curtail the recruitment and funding of suicide bombers headed to Iraq.
Iran’s role in Iraq also changed.
The Iranian government had been a major backer of Shiite militia groups, including the Mahdi Army, led by radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.�But the Iranians also had close ties from the beginning with elements of the Shiite-led coalition government.
In 2008, following Maliki’s military operation to clean out militia groups in Basra, Iran’s leaders seem to have decided that this two-faced strategy had run its course.
Iran then helped broker a ceasefire that was highly favorable to Maliki, and cemented his commanding position inside the Iraqi coalition government.
No doubt Maliki’s hard-line stance on the need for a firm timetable for the withdrawal of US troops was critical to Iran’s decision to throw its weight behind him.
Both the transformation of Baghdad into a Shiite city and the recognition and support of Iraq’s neighbors for the country’s new political order have been instrumental in stabilizing the country.�These changes are likely to be permanent, and offer hope that the wide-scale violence that afflicted the country between 2003 and 2007 will not return after US forces depart.
How Israel Is Losing America
TEL AVIV – The late American diplomat George Ball once argued that Israel needed to be saved from its own suicidal policies “in spite of herself.”
In a 1977 Foreign Affairs article, he called for an even-handed push by the United States for an Arab-Israeli peace.
But, while Ball’s realistic position on the Israel-Palestine conflict is not uncommon among US State Department officials, it has remained off-limits for America’s political establishment, which has long upheld an almost sacred consensus on Israel – until now.
To be sure, to some extent, Ball’s position still represents a cry in the desert.
After all, America has not wavered in its commitment to maintaining Israel’s “qualitative military edge.”
In fact, US President Barack Obama’s administration has broken all historical records in its military aid to Israel, even as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has shown no willingness to use that US taxpayer-funded military edge to take calculated risks for peace.
In this sense, the US is still underwriting Israel’s defiant annexationist policies.
But something is definitely different.
Questions about Palestine are now highly polarized in American politics, with younger generations affected much more by images of an illiberal Israel tyrannizing a disenfranchised Palestinian nation than by the fading memory of the original Zionist epic.
For them, the Israel-Palestine conflict has become a human-rights issue – and a highly contentious one at that.
Israeli apologists are now facing pro-Palestine activism on university campuses on a level unseen in the US since students were protesting the Vietnam War.
A 2014 Gallup poll showed that, while a narrow majority of all Americans considered Israel’s 2014 assault on Gaza justified, only 25% of people under 30 did; 51% of people under 30 declared Israel’s actions to be unjustified.
According to a 2014 Brookings Institution poll, a massive 84% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans would favor a one-state solution, in which a single democratic government guarantees equal rights for all citizens, Israeli and Palestinian.
A December 2015 poll by the same organization indicated that 66% of Americans support a more evenhanded US policy in the Israel-Palestine conflict; among Democrats under 35, that proportion rose to 80%.
US politicians are paying attention.
In recent months, Democratic lawmakers, headed by Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, have called for an investigation into Israel’s “gross violations of human rights,” including torture and extrajudicial executions, against Palestinians.
And Dan Shapiro, the US ambassador in Israel, lit up the Israeli establishment last January, when he suggested in a speech that Israel is essentially implementing apartheid in the West Bank.
Senator Bernie Sanders, in his US presidential campaign, broke the mold when he called for revising the Democratic Party’s position on the Israel-Palestine conflict.
In emphasizing the Palestinians’ plight, Sanders has highlighted not only his own morality-focused worldview – one that can tip into idealism, to be sure – but also his understanding of the mood of an important constituency.
Thanks to his efforts, the Democrats’ convention later this month is set to mark a turning point for the party’s approach to the issue.
The Republican Party is also threatening to turn against Israel, but in a much more damaging way.
Donald Trump, the party’s presumptive nominee for the presidential election in November, has indicated that he would not endorse America’s automatic support for Israel, hinting that he thinks Israel holds more responsibility in the failure of the two-state solution.
Instead, he would be, he says, “a sort of neutral guy” in the Israel-Palestine conflict.
This seems to go over well with his supporters, many of whom like Trump for his anti-establishment approach.
If the establishment politicians they despise support Israel, the logic goes, there must be something wrong with that policy.
The danger lies in the fact that Trump has tapped into an overtly xenophobic element of the conservative voter base.
Indeed, he has been endorsed by white supremacists, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.
Given this, Trump’s rise is very bad news for American Jews – and, indeed, all of America’s minority groups.
Making matters worse, Trump’s impact may even extend beyond the US, with far-right leaders elsewhere, such as Austria’s Norbert Hofer, emulating his tactics to stoke and capitalize on atavistic nativism.
For Israel, a Trump presidency would clearly be a major loss, not least because Israel has long counted on Republican lawmakers to push its agenda.
In 2011, for example, Republicans went so far as to arrange, without informing the White House, for Netanyahu to address Congress, in an effort to block the nuclear deal Obama had long been negotiating with Iran.
But the problem extends further than that.
A less obliging ally in the White House is one thing; having Trump there, implementing his “America First” foreign-policy philosophy, is something else altogether.
While the idea of placing the highest priority on the interests of one’s own country is not in itself unreasonable, Trump’s particular discourse echoes the calls issued by isolationist, anti-Semitic groups prior to World War II for the US to appease Hitler.
To Trump and millions of his supporters, “America First” means the end of America’s enlightened global mission.
Foreign powers, whoever they are, should pay for America’s services.
By ignoring the outcry of European public opinion against its Palestine policy, Israel’s government has definitively lost the support of Europe.
Now, its once-impregnable citadel in America is under threat.
Surely it must realize that ignoring this challenge would amount to walking off a cliff.
Managing the ISIS Crisis
NEW YORK – One day, historians will have their hands full debating the causes of the chaos now overtaking much of the Middle East.
To what extent, they will ask, was it the inevitable result of deep flaws common to many of the region's societies and political systems, and to what extent did it stem from what outside countries chose to do (or not to do)?
But it is we who must deal with the reality and consequences of the region's current disorder.
However we got to where we are in the Middle East, we are where we are, and where we are is a very bad place to be.
The stakes – human, economic, and strategic – are enormous.
Hundreds of thousands have lost their lives; millions have been rendered homeless.
Oil prices are low, but they will not remain so if Saudi Arabia experiences terrorist strikes or instability.
The threat to the region is large and growing, and it menaces people everywhere, as extremist fighters return home and still others who never left are inspired to do terrible things.
Indeed, though the Middle East is facing an abundance of challenges to its stability, none is as large, dangerous, and immediate as the Islamic State.
Those who object to calling the Islamic State a state have a point.
In many ways, IS is a hybrid: part movement, part network, and part organization.
Nor is it defined by geography.
But it does control territory, boasts some 20,000 fighters, and, fueled by religious ideology, has an agenda.
Ultimately, of course, deciding whether to call what has emerged “ISIS" or “ISIL" or the “Islamic State" matters much less than deciding how to take it on.
Any strategy must be realistic.
Eliminating IS is not achievable in the foreseeable future; but weakening it is.
A strategy must also be comprehensive.
First, the flow of money to the Islamic State must be reduced.
Lower oil prices help, and there are only so many banks to rob.
But extortion continues, as does financial support from individuals.
Such flows should be shut down both by governments and financial institutions.
Curtailing the flow of recruits is even more essential.
Countries can do more to make it difficult for individuals to leave for Iraq or Syria; a Europe-wide watch list, for example, would help.
But nothing would have a greater impact than Turkey deciding that it will no longer allow itself to be a conduit, and that it will enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 2178, which calls for stronger international cooperation against terrorism.
Another component of any strategy must be to counter IS's appeal and propaganda.
This means publicizing the misery it has caused to those living under its rule.
It also means persuading Muslim religious leaders and scholars to make the case that IS's behavior is illegitimate from the standpoint of Islam.
Of course, any strategy must challenge IS directly in Iraq and Syria.
In Iraq, there is some evidence that its momentum has been halted; but the growing role of Iran and the Shia militias it backs all but guarantees that many Iraqi Sunnis will come to sympathize with or even support the Islamic State, whatever their misgivings.
This is why outsiders should place greater emphasis on providing military and political support to Kurdish forces and Sunni tribes.
Syria is a far more difficult case, given its civil war and the competition among outsiders for influence.
Attacks from the air on IS forces are necessary but insufficient.
Because IS is a territorially based entity, there must be a ground dimension if the effort is to progress; after all, only ground forces can take and hold territory.
The best approach would be to create a multinational force consisting of soldiers from neighboring countries, particularly Jordan.
The United States and other NATO countries could offer assistance, but the fight must be waged largely by other Sunnis.
What is occurring in the region is a clash within a civilization; to enable IS to portray it as a conflict between civilizations – and itself as the true defender of Islam – would be a grave strategic mistake.
Moderate Syrian opposition forces and local Kurds could be part of such a multinational Sunni force, but they are not in a position to substitute for it.
If such an expeditionary force cannot be formed, air attacks can be stepped up, thereby at least slowing IS and buying time to develop alternative strategies.
Under such a scenario, IS would remain less a problem to be solved and more a situation to be managed.
Diplomacy cannot play a large role at this point.
No solution can be imposed, given disagreements among the outside countries with a stake in Syria and the strength of both IS and the Syrian government.
What diplomacy may be able to do is reduce, if not end, the fighting between the Syrian government and its own people, as the UN is attempting to do in Aleppo.
The biggest danger in 2015 may well be a widening of the regional crisis to Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Intelligence and military support for both countries will be essential, as will enhanced efforts to help Jordan shoulder its massive refugee burden.
In this time of unprecedented turmoil in the Middle East, one of the region's basic rules still applies: No matter how bad the situation, it can always become worse.
To put it bluntly: Neuer cheated, and then boasted about it.
By any normal ethical standards, what Neuer did was wrong. But does the fact that Neuer was playing football mean that the only ethical rule is: “Win at all costs”?
In soccer, that does seem to be the prevailing ethic. The most famous of these incidents was Diego Maradona’s goal in Argentina’s 1986 World Cup match against England, which he later described as having been scored &#160;“a little with the head of&#160;Maradona&#160;and a little with the&#160;hand of God.”
Replays left no doubt that it was the hand of Maradona that scored the goal. Twenty years later, he admitted in a BBC interview that he had intentionally acted as if it were a goal, in order to deceive the referee.
Something similar happened last November, in a game between France and Ireland that decided which of the two nations went to the World Cup.
The French striker Thierry Henry used his hand to control the ball and pass to a teammate, who scored the decisive goal.
Asked about the incident after the match, Henry said: “I will be honest, it was a handball. But I’m not the ref.

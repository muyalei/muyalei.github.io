By balancing autonomy and cooperation, Britain could create 500,000 more jobs during the next decade.
Because it has not adopted the euro, the UK has retained the autonomy to set interest rates; but integration into Europe’s single market has yielded clear gains in terms of growth and employment.
Similarly, if Britain were to lead efforts to establish a level playing field for digital, energy, and services – particularly financial services – it could ensure greater competitiveness for Europe as a whole.
Economic reforms are only the beginning.
Britain can and should champion an agenda that confronts questions of energy efficiency (through an energy and environmental union), fair taxation (through a plan for dealing with tax havens), and security (through heightened cross-border intelligence gathering and policing against terrorism and illegal immigration).
The British blueprint for a reformed Europe should be bold and far-sighted, recognizing the social dimension to the single market and deepening pan-European collaboration in scientific research.
By embracing the reality that we can achieve more through cooperation than isolation, such a blueprint could become the agenda for the UK Presidency of the EU in 2017 and usher in an era of greater cross-border engagement.
We could also use this moment of leadership to advocate for a more cooperative approach to international development and conflict resolution, including a modern European-led Marshall Plan for North Africa and the Middle East.
Britain has an opportunity to be at the forefront of shaping the next stage of Europe’s development.
For the last, post-imperial half-century, Britain has struggled to find a role that suits our sense of destiny.
Through active engagement with Europe, we can show that we are more than one half of a special relationship with America, more than one twenty-eighth of the NATO alliance, and much more than just one member of an ever-growing EU.
On June 23, we should demonstrate that Britain’s future lies in leading Europe, not in leaving it.
Britain by Itself
LONDON – The United Kingdom’s general election is a little more than a month away, but already the campaign seems to have been with us forever, rolling implacably forward, but with little evidence of any genuine excitement – or even significant movement in the polls.
Support for the two main contenders – the Labour Party and the ruling Conservative Party – seems stuck in the low-to-mid 30s.
The Conservatives hope that the government’s record on the economy will convince undecided voters to break in their favor late in the campaign.
Maybe they are right; they deserve to be.
In the meantime, Labour seems to be hoping for who-knows-what to turn the tide, while keeping their collective fingers crossed that they will not be eviscerated in Scotland, where the Scottish National Party is threatening to sweep the board.
One surprise is the election campaign’s insularity.
A dark cloud, in the form of a possible referendum on whether the UK will remain in the European Union hangs over the outcome, but no one talks about it much.
Prime Minister David Cameron has said that a referendum is needed in order to prevent the country from sleepwalking toward an accidental and disastrous EU exit.
And so it must come as a surprise to some of Britain’s EU partners that none of the country’s politicians seems to be making any effort to wake a somnambulant public.
More broadly, while much of the world seems to be going to hell in a handbasket, there has been little talk about Britain’s international role and responsibilities.
The UK was once famous for punching above its weight in global affairs, but perhaps the country no longer really matters much – if only because it does not want to matter.
The closest anyone has come to putting some international fizz into the campaign was when US President Barack Obama fired a couple of warning shots across the UK’s bow.
The Obama administration seems bent on proving that the so-called “special relationship” goes beyond raucous backslapping.
The first salvo – a warning that Britain should not be overly accommodating toward China – followed the UK’s decision to join China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
But the problem is far broader than the AIIB.
In any case, it is doubtful that anyone in London will take much notice.
These days, policy on China is driven entirely by the Treasury, which subscribes to the view that one can do business with the Chinese only from a position of servility.
The second barrage was over a more serious matter, regarding defense spending.
The criticism was directed at all European members of NATO, but it was clear that the US government believes that Britain bears a special responsibility to maintain its military commitments.
The UK has a long track record of scolding its European NATO partners for not spending the 2% of GDP that each has pledged to dedicate to defense; now it appears that Britain itself risks falling short.
There is an economic argument against assigning a fixed percentage of national wealth to a given departmental budget.
There is a very real risk in all of this.
The fact that neither of the major parties is prepared to make the case for increasing defense spending sends the wrong sort of message to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The proper response to Russian adventurism in Ukraine should not only be to work with the rest of the EU to help the government in Kyiv steady its economy; it should also include ramping up defense spending and convincing NATO members to do the same.
It is unfortunate that some of the most important issues facing the UK are being ignored in the country’s current election campaign.
Whatever the outcome when voters head to the polls on May 7, the next government will have to deal with reality.
The country’s defense posture and Russia’s threat to European security are sure to be near the top of the next prime minister’s agenda.
Ukraine’s Debt Dilemma
CAMBRIDGE – Insecurity is haunting Ukraine – and not just geopolitical insecurity, but economic insecurity as well.
Output is in freefall.
The country’s external deficit is exploding, and borrowing costs have spiked precisely as financing has become imperative.
The International Monetary Fund has recognized the danger, approving a $17 billion loan in April to stabilize the economy and avert default.
But the Fund was overly optimistic about Ukraine’s prospects and its ability to fill the financing gap.
It is now clear that $17 billion will not be enough.
The IMF had hoped that tensions with Russia would ease, allowing other lenders to step up.
Instead, continuing conflict has complicated risk assessments and curtailed Kyiv’s access to external finance, raising the likelihood of a disruptive debt default.
Under normal circumstances, there would be little cause for worry.
As late as last year, the government’s debt was less than 40% of GDP.
Still, for understandable reasons, few investors are keen to lend Ukraine more money.
These short-term liquidity problems will test the country’s ability to meet its debt obligations.
This is not only unfortunate; it also was avoidable.
Indeed, Ukraine’s struggles highlight the need for an agreed framework to resolve sovereign-debt difficulties and govern IMF lending.
Under the IMF’s current lending framework, if it is “highly probable” that a borrower’s debt is sustainable, the Fund will extend a conditional loan, even for large amounts, to tide it over.
But if a country fails the solvency test, it must impose a sufficiently deep haircut on its bondholders to bring it to the “high probability” standard needed to qualify for IMF assistance.
In such circumstances, restructuring is desirable, because it prevents the money injected by the IMF from simply going to pay off a country’s creditors, which in Ukraine’s case includes Russia.
And, because the IMF is virtually always paid back, restructuring avoids putting domestic taxpayers on the hook for a creditor bailout.
But, though this approach works in some circumstances, it is poorly suited for cases of genuine uncertainty like Ukraine.
Who, after all, can say whether Ukraine’s debt is sustainable?
The answer today could change tomorrow.
To address cases like this, IMF staff has suggested “re-profiling” rather than restructuring the debt.
Re-profiling means lengthening the maturity of bonds while preserving principal and, generally, the coupons.
The country then implements a reform program while receiving financial assistance from the Fund.
This approach would give the country more time to pay without forcing it into default.
The government would have an opportunity to restore economic growth and get its debt obligations under control. The heavy social and financial costs of an expensive bailout or a disruptive restructuring could thereby be avoided.
Re-profiling would not be straightforward.
To avoid exciting the markets, it would have to be voluntary.
Persuading the bondholders to agree would be challenging – even more so in light of recent court decisions in the United States that strengthen the hand of holdout investors.
But there is no superior alternative.
Ukraine would be an ideal candidate for re-profiling.
Given uncertainty about the country’s near-term prospects, both a mega-bailout and a full-fledged debt restructuring would be overkill.
An extension of maturities on its debt repayments is precisely what it needs to weather the storm.
But, in order to proceed in this way, the IMF must address a second flaw in its current approach: the so-called “systemic exemption” introduced in 2010.
That exemption was created for Greece, because there was no “high probability” that Greek sovereign debt was sustainable, and the IMF’s European members worried that a Greek restructuring would spread financial contagion to other eurozone countries.
In response to their pressure, the Fund gave itself the right to lend to a country whose debt is of questionable sustainability whenever default supposedly threatens the international system.
Yet, rather than resolving the crisis, the systemic exemption only prolonged it.
Greece’s debt started out unsustainable, and it remained unsustainable.
The massive IMF-European Union bailout did nothing to catalyze private capital inflows.
When the inevitable restructuring finally came in 2012, it was, in the IMF’s words, “too little, too late.”
Unfortunately, the same danger arises in the context of re-profiling.
Investors may worry that if one country re-profiles, other countries in its position will re-profile as well.
Governments will hesitate to recommend re-profiling for fear, justified or not, of destabilizing the international system, and will encourage the IMF to lend large amounts instead.
IMF staff have recommended scrapping the systemic exemption.
But important shareholders, not just crisis-hit eurozone countries, but also the United States, are reluctant to go along.
The Fund needs to act quickly to remove the systemic exemption and create room for the smart use of sovereign-debt re-profiling.
Countries like Ukraine depend on it.
Europe’s War in Ukraine
BERLIN – War is ravaging Europe’s east.
Ukraine is a victim of Russian military aggression, and, like it or not, its fate will essentially determine that of Europe’s, because the current crisis will define the rules and principles that Europeans live by in the twenty-first century.
Will Europe be governed by the principles of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and the inviolability of national borders? Or will sheer might and the willingness to use force triumph?
Will “managed” democracy and spheres of influence trump the right of countries, large or small, to determine their own future?
With the Cold War’s end and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity quickly became a cornerstone of the European order.
This strategic fact is more evident now than ever before.
Simply put, today’s democratic Ukraine is fighting for Europe’s future.
Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to restore an international order based on exclusive spheres of influence controlled by major powers – the system that prevailed in Europe’s war-torn eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
A European Ukraine and the European Union stand in the way of this goal.
That is why current Russian policy seeks to destabilize Ukraine permanently, especially militarily and financially.
In its own interest, Europe must not allow this policy to prevail.
Despite the war in eastern Ukraine, the country has managed to take important steps toward democracy since the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych last February.
Indeed, since the “Euromaidan” uprising began in Kyiv in November 2013, a new Ukraine has emerged.
Free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections have brought to power leaders who, by implementing radical reforms, are determined to realize voters’ demands for a modern economy and an end to corruption.
Nonetheless, the goal of domestic political stabilization is far from reached.
Apart from tensions within the Ukrainian government, the main reason is the country’s dire financial situation.
The United States, the European Commission, and the EU’s main member states all agree, at least in principle, that Ukraine needs quick and substantial financial help in order to be able to resist Russian aggression.
Likewise, they agree to support the deep social and economic reforms that Ukraine must carry out.
So far, no package has been put together, which is deeply troublesome, because the IMF is authorized to release the money it pledged only if Ukraine’s financial stability is guaranteed for at least 12 months. The country is facing a severe shortage of money, which could lead to a serious financial crisis, in addition to the ongoing and dramatic military crisis.
The EU’s difficulty in devising a concrete financial commitment stems from its dearth of financial means.
A major weakness of EU foreign policy is its lack of versatile instruments for allocating financial aid to neighboring countries.
It would be absurd if Ukraine were to slide into a financial crisis because the EU could not agree on how to raise the funds to prevent it.
The way to avoid that outcome is to adjust one of the EU’s two instruments for non-eurozone members to meet Ukraine’s needs: The Macro-Financial Assistance scheme, a versatile instrument that can combine loans and direct subsidies; or the balance-of-payments assistance facility, which could complement an IMF program to EU countries.
Both instruments could be subject to conditions designed to ensure that the funds do not sustain rampant corruption, but flow instead to where they are needed most.
Moreover, the commitments should be made in the context of a donor agreement that bars the aid from being used to make direct payments to Russia.
Today, it is more important to give adequate financial support to Ukraine than to impose new sanctions on Russia.
That is why Russia may also be interested in a donor conference and fresh money from Europe for Ukraine.
Indeed, economic sanctions not only exacerbate the crisis in Russia; they also negatively affect other European countries.
By contrast, financial aid to Ukraine would clearly signal that the EU will not tolerate the country’s destabilization, while providing economic stimulus in Ukraine and the entire region.
Equally important, if the West’s response to Russian aggression toward Ukraine is effectively limited to economic sanctions, Putin will more easily be able to blame the West and its alleged hostility toward Russia for the collapse in ordinary Russians’ living standards, thus enabling him to double down on aggressive nationalism.
Today, the only thing needed to convert EU funds into financial aid for Ukraine is political will.
The most immediate step should be an initiative by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to get the funds flowing with a minimum of bureaucratic delay.
Even if doing so takes some time, initiating the process would send a powerful political signal of the EU’s determination to support Ukraine.
The announcement alone would help Ukraine in its acute financial plight.
Many of Europe’s leaders will meet this week at the Munich Security Conference.
They should seize this opportunity to urge Juncker to start the proceedings needed to repurpose one of the EU’s two available funds.
A financial crisis, in addition to the military and political crisis, would be devastating for Ukraine, and there is no good reason why it cannot be avoided.
Keeping Europe’s Eastern Promise
KYIV – For many years, the European Union’s eastward expansion seemed unstoppable.
But with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin appears to have succeeded in ordering a halt to Europe’s efforts to extend democracy, the rule of law, and open markets throughout the continent.
The EU must not kowtow to his demands.
Ukraine’s fate has become Europe’s fate.
Indeed, Putin not only wants to stop European political, civic, and social norms from taking root within Ukraine; he wants to roll them back in the Baltics, the Balkans, and anywhere else in Europe made politically brittle by economic crisis and/or demagogic populism.
The EU Eastern Partnership summit in Riga can and must demonstrate Europe’s determination to defend its unity, security, and values in the face of Russian aggression.
And it must do so in concrete ways, not simply with quickly forgotten official communiqués for which the Kremlin and its Ukrainian separatist proxies have only contempt.
Of paramount importance is to make the new policy a true partnership among peoples.
The citizens of the partner countries must become the real beneficiaries if this partnership is to become more than the inert agreement that it has been.
Generous EU commitments on mobility, aid to SMEs and entrepreneurs, and a vast increase in educational opportunities are among the key ingredients that could make such a partnership politically popular for a vast majority.
Ukraine should be the centerpiece of any effort to revive the Eastern Partnership as a way to attract the support of Europeans who remain outside the EU.
Yes, the news from my country remains bad.
Thousands of our citizens are dead.
Hundreds of thousands are now refugees in their own homeland.
The Minsk II cease-fire agreement has failed to restrain Russian/separatist forces.
Although Ukraine’s economy is no longer in free-fall, as it was last winter, GDP has declined by a quarter since Russian troops first invaded in February 2014.
Official unemployment now stands at over 10%, compared to 7.3% before Russia’s occupation and annexation of Crimea.
Our national debt is mounting by the day to levels that inspired The Economist to suggest that we may become the “Greece of the east.”
Moreover, much of our economy remains in separatist hands, and they, no surprise, are running the stolen assets into the ground.
In the face of such calamitous conditions, Ukraine’s government is a bit like the proverbial Dutch boy who put his finger in a dike to stop the sea from leaking through.
Despite herculean efforts, more leaks continue to appear.
The simple truth that Europe must grasp is that we Ukrainians simply do not have enough fingers to plug all the leaks, and thus rebuild our economy, on our own.
Despite the depth of Ukraine’s plight, Europe cannot avoid taking up the challenge that Putin has set before it.
After all, if Putin succeeds in turning Ukraine into a failed state with a frozen conflict embedded within it, he will seek the same outcome all along the EU’s borders, from Estonia to Greece.
Fortunately, the EU has a real partner in Ukraine, whose people’s devotion to Europe has been tested by snipers in the streets of Kyiv and now by the Russian army.
Their courage, and their newfound political activism, has stiffened the government’s backbone in implementing needed reforms and made it impossible for any political actor in Ukraine to buck the pro-EU consensus.
The EU can stiffen it even more by demanding much greater clarity in the fight against corruption.
Yet, given the war in the eastern Donbas region, the shattering of so much of our economy, and the precarious nature of our government’s finances, the International Monetary Fund and others are clearly asking too much of Ukrainians.
The idea that Ukraine can embrace the economic “shock therapy” that Poland pursued a quarter-century ago is the type of cookie-cutter policymaking that resulted in the 2008 global financial crisis.
That is why the Eastern Partnership, if it is to be renewed, must embrace bold new initiatives for Ukraine, and not try to reheat old policies designed for very different circumstances.
A recent report from the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies provides some guidance concerning what the EU should now try to do for Ukraine.
For starters, the EU should help us create a more stable exchange-rate regime to overcome the currency volatility that has wracked our economy since Russia’s invasion.
And, although fiscal consolidation is necessary, given the state of our economy, Ukraine’s most vulnerable people are now enduring a hand-to-mouth existence.
They have nothing more to sacrifice.
On the contrary, they need relief, and Europe should insist that its programs, and those of the IMF, take their needs into account.
Perhaps most important for the long term, the EU must honor its commitment to the deep free-trade and association agreement that Ukraine’s previous government refused to sign in late 2013.
After all, it was to secure that agreement that young Ukrainians braved former President Viktor Yanukovych’s snipers, and are now braving the might of the Russian army.
To follow through would do more to anchor Ukrainians’ confidence in their European future, and to convince the Kremlin that it cannot succeed in rolling back European values, than anything else the EU might do.
One clear way that Europe can demonstrate that its association agreement with Ukraine remains alive is to encourage investment in my country.
Since Russia’s invasion, FDI into Ukraine has collapsed, which is precisely what Putin wants.
The EU can demonstrate its commitment to Ukraine’s economic renewal by having the European Investment Bank invest in a showcase infrastructure project, say improved rail links to the EU.
The EU faces a stark choice: a renewed Eastern Partnership or a renewed division of Europe.
The decisions that it makes, beginning at the Riga summit, will determine Europe’s fate for decades to come.
Last Chance for Ukraine and Europe
LONDON – The European Union stands at a crossroads.
The shape it takes five years from now will be decided in the coming 3-5 months.
Year after year, the EU has successfully muddled through its difficulties.
But now it has to deal with two sources of existential crisis: Greece and Ukraine.
That may prove too much.
Greece’s long-festering crisis has been mishandled by all parties from the outset.
Emotions now are running so high that muddling through is the only constructive alternative.
But Ukraine is different.
It is a black-and-white case.
Vladimir Putin’s Russia is the aggressor, and Ukraine, in defending itself, is defending the values and principles on which the EU was built.
Yet Europe treats Ukraine like another Greece.
That is the wrong approach, and it is producing the wrong results.
Putin is gaining ground in Ukraine, and Europe is so preoccupied with Greece that it hardly pays any attention.
Putin’s preferred outcome in Ukraine is to engineer a financial and political collapse that destabilizes the country, and for which he can disclaim responsibility, rather than a military victory that leaves him in possession of – and responsible for – part of Ukraine.
He has shown this by twice converting a military victory into a ceasefire.
The deterioration in Ukraine’s position between the two ceasefire agreements – Minsk I, negotiated last September, and Minsk II, completed in February – shows the extent of Putin’s success.
But that success is temporary, and Ukraine is too valuable an ally for the EU to abandon.
There is something fundamentally wrong with EU policy.
How else could Putin’s Russia have outmaneuvered Ukraine’s allies, which used to lead the free world?
The trouble is that Europe has been drip-feeding Ukraine, just as it has Greece.
As a result, Ukraine barely survives, while Putin has the first-mover advantage.
He can choose between hybrid war and hybrid peace, and Ukraine and its allies are struggling to respond.
The deterioration of Ukraine’s situation is accelerating.
The financial collapse of which I had been warning for months occurred in February, when the hryvnia’s value plummeted 50% in a few days, and the National Bank of Ukraine had to inject large amounts of money to rescue the banking system.
The climax was reached on February 25, when the central bank introduced import controls and raised interest rates to 30%.
Since then, President Petro Poroshenko’s jawboning has brought the exchange rate back close to the level on which Ukraine’s 2015 budget was based.
But the improvement is extremely precarious.
This temporary collapse has shaken public confidence and endangered the balance sheets of Ukrainian banks and companies that have hard-currency debts.
It has also undermined the calculations on which Ukraine’s programs with the International Monetary Fund are based.
The IMF’s Extended Fund Facility became insufficient even before it was approved.
But EU member states, facing their own fiscal constraints, have shown no willingness to consider additional bilateral aid.
So Ukraine continues to teeter on the edge of the abyss.
At the same time, a radical reform program within Ukraine is gaining momentum, and slowly becoming visible to both the Ukrainian public and the European authorities.
There is a stark contrast between the deteriorating external situation and the continuing progress in internal reforms.
This gives the situation in Kyiv an air of unreality.
One plausible scenario is that Putin achieves his optimal objective and Ukraine’s resistance crumbles.
Europe would be flooded with refugees – two million seems to be a realistic estimate.
Many people expect that this would mark the beginning of Cold War II.
The likelier outcome is that a victorious Putin would have many friends in Europe, and that the sanctions on Russia would be allowed to lapse.
That is the worst possible outcome for Europe, which would become even more divided, turning into a battleground for influence between Putin’s Russia and the United States.
The EU would cease to be a functioning political force in the world (especially if Greece also left the eurozone).
A more likely scenario is that Europe muddles through by drip-feeding Ukraine.
Ukraine does not collapse, but the oligarchs reassert themselves and the new Ukraine begins to resemble the old Ukraine.
Putin would find this almost as satisfactory as a complete collapse.
But his victory would be less secure, as it would lead to a second Cold War that Russia would lose, just as the Soviet Union lost the first.
Putin’s Russia needs oil at $100 a barrel and will start running out of currency reserves in 2-3 years.
The latest chapter in what I call the “Tragedy of the European Union” is that the EU will lose the new Ukraine.
The principles that Ukraine is defending – the very principles on which the EU is based – will be abandoned, and the EU will have to spend a lot more money on defending itself than it would need to spend helping the new Ukraine succeed.
There is also a more hopeful scenario.
The new Ukraine is still alive and determined to defend itself.
Though Ukraine, on its own, is no match for Russia’s military might, its allies could decide to do “whatever it takes” to help, short of becoming involved in a direct military confrontation with Russia or violating the Minsk agreement.
Doing so would not only help Ukraine; it would also help the EU to recapture the values and principles that it seems to have lost.
Needless to say, this is the scenario I advocate.
The Right Intervention in Ukraine
STOCKHOLM – The ongoing Greek drama may have transfixed Europe and the world, but the great crisis in Europe’s east has not gone away.
Ukraine remains under partial occupation by Russian-backed separatists, with intermittent fighting still taking place, despite the Minsk II ceasefire agreement.
The on-and-off fighting in Ukraine’s Donbas region since the Minsk deal was signed in February has made one thing clear.
If Russia is serious about seeking a solution to the conflict, it should be prepared to endorse the deployment of an international peacekeeping mission and force.
Such a mission could begin the process of rehabilitating the region, allow those displaced by the violence to return, and facilitate the reintegration of the Donbas into Ukraine with appropriate safeguards and devolved powers.
A useful model for this approach is at hand.
Two decades ago, the international community was entering the final phase of efforts to secure peace in Bosnia.
But there were also lingering conflicts in Croatia, notably in the Eastern Slavonia region, adjacent to Serbia.
Croatian military offensives, first in early May 1995, and a second in early August, had taken back three of four United Nations-protected sectors from separatist Serb control.
But the most important area, Sector East in Eastern Slavonia, remained under firm Serb control.
And, much like Russian President Vladimir Putin on the Ukraine issue today, Serbia’s then-president, Slobodan Milošević, insisted that the issue could be resolved only by direct talks between the Serb separatists and the Croat government in Zagreb.
The reality, of course, was that the Serb separatists were entirely dependent on the political, military, and economic support of Milošević’s Serbia.
And, in the end, Milošević agreed to the deployment of a UN mission and force, which was tasked with ensuring the region’s demilitarization and return to Croat sovereignty, after implementing the necessary safeguards for the Serbs living there.
Today, the UNTAES (United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Sirmium) mission is virtually forgotten – not because it failed, but because it succeeded.
To be sure, not every issue in Eastern Slavonia was sorted out then or in the years since; but there is no longer a conflict, and Croatia and Serbia now enjoy constructive bilateral relations.
This could be a model for the separatist-controlled areas of Donbas if the political will is there to make such an arrangement work.
But is the Kremlin serious about recognizing Ukraine’s sovereignty in the Donbas and resuming normal relations with the West?
At the moment, I strongly doubt it.
It is worth bearing in mind that Russia has driven every step toward escalation in this conflict – including the establishment of the separatist enclaves.
Indeed, the Kremlin appears to be waiting for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko’s government to fail and the West to split on the issue and stop taking an interest in its resolution.
At that point, perhaps, Putin will be ready to move against Ukraine to secure his own desired long-term outcome.
But if Ukraine’s government and the West remain united, the Kremlin might see that its enclaves in Donbas represent a threat mainly to Russia itself.
After all, the grim reality is that the separatist enclaves are in economic free-fall, with their societies becoming increasingly criminalized.
Donbas risks becoming a tar baby for which no one wants to take responsibility.
As this becomes apparent, Russia’s leaders could start to envisage a UNTAES-type solution for the region.
Absent any other arrangement, the Kremlin will have to do just that.
Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell’s doctrine – if you break it, you own it – applies to Putin’s intervention in Ukraine as much as to George W. Bush’s misadventure in Iraq.
There certainly are very difficult issues that must be sorted out before a peacekeeping mission could go into Donbas, notably the composition and formal mandate of whatever force is deployed.
But, again, if the will is there, these questions should not be intractable.
Such a mission could then ensure the real implementation of the political provisions of the Minsk II agreement.
Genuinely free and fair local elections, with the participation of all displaced people and refugees, will never be possible without a substantial international presence.
Today, this idea is sure to be dead on arrival. So was UNTAES in the early discussions on Eastern Slavonia.
The Milošević regime then sounded exactly like the Kremlin now.
But tomorrow really is another day, and it is certainly not too early to start exploring options that promise not just to manage the conflict, but to resolve it.
Such an intervention might work – but only if and when both sides genuinely want a solution.
We are not there yet.
But if both Ukraine and the West stand firm and act to block further Russian efforts at destabilization, that day might come.
We should be ready.
Ukraine Loses Its Way
PRAGUE – Since the election of President Viktor Yanukovych in 2010, Ukraine has experienced a significant and alarming deterioration in its democratic framework.
Fundamental tenets of a democratic society, such as freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press are increasingly coming under pressure.
And the prosecution of opposition members, which has now culminated in the arrest and detention of former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko – during an ongoing trial that most of the West has deemed political – seems to confirm that the rule of law is being brushed aside.
Given Ukraine’s strategic importance, the country’s fate has become an urgent matter of concern not only for Europe, but for the entire international community.
Among the most worrying factors underlying Ukraine’s anti-democratic turn are the following:
Consolidation of power.
After Viktor Yanukovych’s election last year, the Constitutional Court rescinded constitutional changes made in 2004 as part of the settlement that brought about a peaceful end to the Orange Revolution.
By doing so, a consensus was reversed that aimed to reduce the presidency’s powers and move toward a more parliamentary system.
Instead, Ukraine’s president is now increasingly consolidating his total control over the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary.
Endemic corruption.
Corruption is widely believed to be endemic in the country’s police, secret service, administration, government, and Prosecutor’s Office.
On Transparency International´s Corruption Perceptions Index 2010, Ukraine scored 2.4 on a scale from zero (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean).
Efforts to combat corruption are at best half-hearted and are not bringing any apparent results.
Corruption cripples the country´s institutions and the government´s inaction on this problem is also having an economic impact.
Increased Security Service (SBU) activity.
Evidence of increased SBU activity with political motives was presented in various human rights groups´ reports.
Individuals, NGOs, and journalists have been either overtly threatened or placed under surveillance.
For example, in July 2010, Nico Lange, the head of the Ukrainian office of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, was detained at the Kyiv airport after publishing a critical report on the process of Ukrainian regional elections (the incident was subsequently presented as a “misunderstanding”).
In September, SBU searched the offices of organizations funded by philanthropist George Soros; in October 2010, the offices of the Vinnitsa Human Rights Group were also searched by police without a court order.
Harassment of opposition parties and independent media.
Theongoing criminal proceedings against opposition politicians, including Tymoshenko, together with the impact of changes in the electoral law to favor the president and his supporters, are weakening opposition forces.
Harassment of the independent media ranges from administrative obstruction to much worse.
The disappearance of Vasyl Klymentyev, the editor-in-chief of Novyi Styl, a newspaper which focuses heavily on corruption in the Kharkiv region, has never been fully investigated.
Most television channels are in the hands of four groups, most of which have close links to the ruling Party of Regions.
Valery Khoroshkovsky’s continued ownership of Inter Media Group, in addition to his roles as head of the country’s security service and as a Council Member of the National Bank of Ukraine, is an obvious conflict of interest.
Overall, there is clear evidence of a decline in media pluralism since President Yanukovych came to power.
A weak civil society.
While observers believe that further harassment of NGOs is constrained by the administration’s wariness of international reaction, particularly from the EU, the operating environment for civil-society organizations remains extremely difficult, and they have no opportunities for genuine inclusion in policymaking.
Ukraine has reached a crossroads.
One signpost points towards democracy; the other towards autocracy.
The former path leads to membership in the European Union; the latter would take Ukraine to a darker and more dangerous destination.
Millions of Ukraine’s citizens favor EU membership, but their enthusiasm is tempered by the absence of a clear EU policy towards Ukraine.
Meanwhile, the administration of President Yanukovych proclaims its willingness to join the EU, but has failed to introduce the changes needed to meet the qualifying criteria.
As a result, Ukraine is unlikely to be invited to start membership negotiations anytime soon.  
It is in the EU’s vital interest to strive for a far more active policy towards Ukraine than it has so far.
The current Polish EU presidency should hark back to the origins of Poland’s thriving democracy, and recall the essential support that it received from the West a generation ago.
A similar effort is needed for Ukraine today, and that effort should not be set aside for reasons of political expedience, or, for that matter, pursued for reasons of simple economic self-interest.
We urge the EU and its member states to insist that the rule of law is respected.
At the very least, the EU should demand that Tymoshenko and the other opposition leaders are set free on bail so that they can more vigorously defend themselves in court.
A Way Out for Ukraine and Russia
LONDON – The leaders of Russia and Ukraine will meet in Astana, Kazakstan, on January 15 to discuss, once again, an end to the fighting that has roiled eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region since last spring.
Hopes for a viable agreement are not high.
One reason why the crisis in Ukraine has proved so difficult to overcome is that its roots stretch far outside the country’s borders.
Finding a genuine solution will require the resolution of a dispute between Russia and the West that dates back to the 1990s, before Russian President Vladimir Putin came to power.
At its heart, the conflict in Ukraine is about a disagreement over NATO’s expansion into what Russia regards as its “near abroad.”
Fortunately, a solution is possible – but it will require a reworking of Europe’s security architecture.
Both sides are deeply committed to their positions.
In November, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told the BBC that Russia required a “100% guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO.”
That is a promise that Western countries will be unable to provide.
For them, what is at stake is the principle that sovereign countries have the right to chart their own course, rather than be entangled in a larger power’s sphere of influence.
Indeed, it was this principle that, once invoked to justify NATO enlargement in the 1990s, put the two sides on a collision course.
With Russia’s neighbors free to join the alliance, the natural result could only be a new dividing line, one pressing up against the Russian Federation’s western and southern borders.
This outcome was foreseen by the veteran American diplomat George F. Kennan.
In an interview he gave to the New York Times in May 1998, he predicted that NATO enlargement would lead to a new Cold War.
Now that Kennan’s prediction has all but come to pass, the parties to the conflict would be wise to take a lesson from the diplomatic efforts that helped bring the original Cold War to an end – in particular, the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE).
NATO enlargement may have rendered the treaty’s detailed provisions obsolete, but its underlying approach – a transparent inspections regime that enforces limitations on the overall quantity and, crucially, the regional concentrations of ground forces – remains applicable today.
For the West, a revamped CFE Treaty would help mitigate worries about military threats in the area that Russia has traditionally considered its sphere of influence.
Violations of the treaty would be easily detectable and allow time for the West to deploy countermeasures.
In addition, there would be no formal prohibition of NATO membership for Ukraine – or for any other country in the Russian periphery.
For Russia, a new treaty would allow it to live with the hitherto nightmare scenario of Ukrainian accession to NATO; as long as the pact remained in force, Ukraine’s membership would have no military consequences.
NATO, at least in the Russian hinterland, would become first and foremost a political organization.
Above all, a new treaty would allow both Russia and the West to secure their interests in a balanced and binding agreement.
For Russia, this would mean a significant improvement on what it has been offered since the end of the Cold War.
Though invitations by the West to join organizations such as the NATO-Russia Council or the G-8 may have been symbolically important and thus politically valuable, these venues provide only forums for discussion; they do not produce binding agreements.
A new treaty would do more than anything else to bring peace to Ukraine.
It would eliminate the primary motive behind Russia’s support for separatism in the country’s southeast: ensuring that Ukraine remains ineligible for NATO membership.
The dispute over the fate of Crimea would continue; but an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the issue could be made a precondition of the treaty’s entry into full effect.
There are two other obvious objections to this proposal.
The first is that Putin would reject a treaty with NATO.
That should not stop the West from making the offer.
With the Russian economy in serious trouble, Putin may be looking for a way out of his corner.
The second objection is that the West would be best served by simply standing back and watching while sanctions and plunging oil prices bring down Russia’s economy – and ultimately Putin himself.
But this would be an irresponsibly dangerous and ultimately counterproductive strategy.
After all, economic and political breakdown in Russia would have profound adverse consequences well beyond Russia’s borders – particularly for Ukraine.
Why Ukraine Needs Weapons
MUNICH – It has become something of a mantra among diplomats and other foreign-policy analysts that there is no military solution to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
The only viable path to peace and stability, observers almost unanimously proclaim, is a diplomatic one.
But, despite the recent ceasefire agreement announced in Minsk, ongoing violence – reflected in the violent expulsion of Ukrainian forces from the town of Debaltseve – strongly suggests that it is time to consider what is needed to block any Kremlin-imposed military solution.
Three influential American think tanks have already done so, and arrived at the conclusion that the United States should begin supplying Ukraine not only with more non-lethal aid – such as drones, armored Humvees, and medical equipment – but also with “lethal defensive military assistance," in the form of light anti-armor missiles.
European governments, however, remain unwilling to reconsider their position on supplying defensive equipment to Ukraine, and have instead reiterated that a diplomatic solution is the only option.
Of course, from Ukraine's perspective, a one-on-one military confrontation with Russia is not a viable option.
Last year, when separatist forces in the Donbas region appeared to be crumbling under the weight of Ukraine's counter-offensive, it seemed possible that Ukraine would be able to reassert its sovereignty over the area.
But the Kremlin quickly deployed battalion-size tactical groups from the Russian army to support the rebels.
Ukraine's relatively weak forces did not stand a chance.
The move exemplifies Russia's commitment to do whatever it takes to prevent a military defeat of the separatist entities that it has incited and forged into fighting units – a determination that has endured, even as the conflict has placed considerable strain on its armed forces.
Given this, the prospects for Ukraine to reassert control over the Donbas region militarily are so slim that even trying to do so would be foolish.
If one considers the strategic ambitions of the separatists and their Russian patrons, Ukraine's prospects are even bleaker.
Beyond supplying the separatist groups with heavy and advanced weapons, and deploying special units and forces to support them, Russia now appears to be sending in “volunteers" to train a separatist army that could ultimately go on the offensive.
Such an army, separatist leaders hope, will enable them – at the very least – to secure control over the Donbas region.
They would then be positioned to secure a “Novorossiya" statelet extending along the entire Black Sea coast, up to and including Odessa.
And, in all likelihood, some would even dream of an eventual march into Kyiv.
To prevent this scenario from unfolding, a robust political dialogue with the Kremlin is clearly vital, as are continued economic sanctions to make clear that Russia will pay a rising price for ongoing aggression.
But trusting solely in a diplomatic dialogue and sanctions to bring about a lasting peace may be excessively optimistic.
A more comprehensive approach would focus on strengthening Ukraine in every respect.
To this end, political and diplomatic support is essential.
But perhaps even more important is backing for reforms aimed at eliminating corruption and promoting growth.
The recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund is of immediate importance in this respect, and the agreement with the European Union on a Deep and Comprehensive Free-Trade Area is crucial to the country's long-term transformation.
But if separatist groups, with support from Russia, believe that they can control Donbas and the Black Sea coast, efforts to rebuild Ukraine's society and economy will amount to little.
That is why Ukraine's external partners must also help to strengthen the country's defensive capabilities.
In such a charged situation, there will always be hotheads, eager to pursue military options.
But the greater concern is the behavior of pragmatists, who identify weaknesses that can be exploited.
If the Russian-backed separatists view Ukraine's defensive capacity as a serious weakness, there will be little to compel them not to push forward in pursuit of their ambitions.
A political or diplomatic solution would be next to impossible.
Security experts should identify which actions powers like the US and Europe could take to improve Ukraine's defensive capabilities.
The requests for non-lethal equipment made by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the recent Munich Security Conference could provide some guidance.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others are clearly right when they say that there is no purely military solution to the conflict in Ukraine.
But a year of talks and failed agreements has demonstrated that there is no purely diplomatic solution either.
Only by eliminating – or at least seriously diminishing – the potential for the separatists and their Russian backers to continue their military campaign can Ukraine and its partners hope for a lasting political solution.
Ukraine\u0027s Borgia Campaign
With its accusations about poisonings and conspiracies, Ukraine's presidential election campaign is a spectacle only the Borgias could love.
Ten days ago, Viktor Yushchenko, the opposition candidate for president (who is leading in the polls), disappeared from the campaign trail. He re-surfaced in Vienna recovering from what at first was thought to be food poisoning.
But it is now widely alleged in Ukraine that Yushchenko's food may have been laced with the deadly drug ricin, once a favorite of KGB assassins, who used it in the murder of Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident, in London in 1978.
In most countries, such charges would seem like paranoid delusions.
Not in Ukraine, where the current prime minister, and Mr Yushchenko's leading rival for president, Viktor Yanukovych, has been twice convicted for violent crimes.
Yushchenko has now resumed campaigning, his face partially paralyzed when he spoke to a huge rally of supporters in Kiev last week.
His opponents cavalierly dismiss the affair, with the deputy head of President Leonid Kuchma's administration suggesting that Yushchenko should hire a food taster.
The matter is now the subject of a criminal investigation.
Suspicions of foul play deepened when the opposition's second-leading figure, Yuliya Tymoshenko, a former deputy prime minister, was summoned by a Moscow prosecutor to answer questions related to charges that years ago she bribed a Russian military officer to benefit the gas firm she headed.
Indeed, Russia's military prosecutor has now issued an international arrest warrant for her, even though the officer she is accused of bribing was acquitted in a trial in Moscow last year of the very charges that prosecutors now want to question her about.
Coming on the heels of Yushchenko's alleged poisoning, the timing of the move against Tymoshenko appears to be anything but coincidental.
Indeed, the case was reopened while Yushchenko was hospitalized - thus threatening to decapitate the opposition with barely a month to go before the presidential election on October 31.
Such strong-arm tactics are all the more distressing because according to the most recent opinion polls Ukraine's opposition has a real chance of winning.
Against all odds, Ukraine's opposition groups have helped forge a civil society and healthy political parties far beyond anything seen in President Vladimir Putin's Russia.
Indeed, Russia's president is rallying behind Yanukovych, who has open backing from Russia's ambassador in Kiev, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
Yanukovych represents the Donetsk clan, one of several geographically defined oligarchic groups that compete to dominate Ukrainian business and politics.
He has little sway over either the Kiev clan, led by Viktor Medvedchuk, Kuchma's chief of staff, or the Dnipropetrovsk clan of Viktor Pinchuk, Kuchma's sonâinâlaw.
But both oligarchs prefer Yanukovych to Yushchenko, who has vowed to "end corruption" and send "bandits" to jail.
Yushchenko's promises resonate across Ukraine.
Even though the oligarchs control all but one of the main television stations, he remains popular.
Under President Kuchma, the economy has recently started to boom - thanks partly to Yushchenko's brief, reformist premiership four years ago - but the oligarchs' grip has grown tighter.
In June, a consortium led by Pinchuk and Rinat Akhmetov, a Donetsk magnate, bought a stateâowned steelworks in an auction allegedly rigged to specifically exclude foreign bidders offering two or three times as much.
The move was probably more than just another property grab; it also suggests an effort to forge an interâclan alliance for the post-Kuchma period.
Such an alliance would make Yushchenko's rule, if he wins, more difficult - and he knows it.
So he is cagey about plans to confront the oligarchs.
"I don't exclude investigations of the clans behind Medvedchuk or Yanukovych, but the rest of business wants clear rules," he says.
By leaving Pinchuk off this list, Yushchenko may be hinting that he wants a truce with Ukraine's most powerful magnate should he become president.
Europe, America, and the wider world must not stand idle if Ukraine's rulers and oligarchs try to steal this election by any means at their disposal.
Pressure must be brought to bear on Kuchma to ensure that the vote in October is transparently free and fair.
Otherwise, Kiev might witness the type of protests - and the risk of civil war - that brought down Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia in 2000 and Eduard Schevardnadze's government in Georgia last year.
Applying pressure won't be easy.
For years, President Kuchma has been in the West's doghouse, but Europe and the United States stepped gingerly, wary of pushing him into Russia's waiting embrace.
Moreover, Kuchma's decision to send Ukrainian troops to Iraq divided the Western alliance, as he came into America's good graces.
Perhaps unwisely, Yushchenko publicly called for troop withdrawal from Iraq after casualties were sustained.
But President Bush cannot promote democracy in Iraq by cynically sacrificing it in Ukraine.
Europe and the US must address the corruption allegedly surrounding the Kuchma government and its efforts to maintain power by manipulating the choice of his successor.
All efforts to subvert the electoral process should be met with clear warnings that current and future aid, as well as trade privileges such as accelerated WTO accession, will be in jeopardy.
Most ordinary Ukrainians desperately want to be part of Europe. These aspirations can be used to encourage Kiev to turn toward the West and democracy.
But it must be made clear that regardless of Ukraine's geopolitical importance, the West will not shy away from confronting it when democracy and fundamental human rights are threatened.
Ukraine’s Dollar Addiction
KYIV – Inflation in Ukraine is skyrocketing.
By March, it reached 26% per year and continues to rise.
Although prices are increasing around the world, Ukraine’s inflation is extreme, twice as much as in neighboring Russia.
Amazingly, instead of dampening inflation, Ukraine’s central bank is stoking it.
Ukraine’s prices started spiraling out of control around the time when Yuliya Tymoshenko returned as prime minister last December.
Malicious observers suggest that she is to blame for pursuing populist social expenditures.
But this is false.
State finances are generally in good shape, with public debt at just 11% of GDP.
According to the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), international reserves have grown steadily and now stand at $33 billion.
The real cause of Ukraine’s inflation is that its currency, the hryvnia, remains pegged to the US dollar.
When the dollar falls in value, as it has, Ukraine’s very open economy imports inflation.
In the last year, the dollar’s value dropped by 12% against the euro, which is a more important currency than the dollar in Ukraine’s foreign trade.
The International Monetary Fund has persistently warned Ukraine that its dollar peg could cause a financial crisis because of over- or undervaluation, and for years has called on Ukraine to free its exchange rate.
But the NBU refused to do so – making Ukraine the last country in Central and Eastern Europe to tie its currency to the dollar. 
Ukraine’s powerful industrialists praised the NBU’s low exchange-rate policy, believing it makes the country more competitive.
They ignore the fact that the NBU can control only the nominal appreciation of the hryvnia.
But costs are determined by the real revaluation, which is the sum of exchange-rate changes and inflation.
The dollar peg has also forced the NBU to pursue a loose monetary policy.
Ukraine’s current refinance rate is 16% a year, 10% less than inflation, which means that Ukraine has a negative real interest rate of 10% a year.
As a result, Ukraine’s money supply, M3, exploded by no less than 52% in the last year, which points to inflation hitting 30% soon.
The NBU’s leadership understands that it must act to contain inflation, but its insistence on the dollar peg ties their hands, because it prevents them from raising interest rates sufficiently.
Instead, they have reverted to strict reserve requirements, effectively rationing credit and thereby causing a domestic credit squeeze in the midst of the current international financial crisis, which is likely to force some medium-sized banks into bankruptcy because of liquidity problems.
Rationing is always worse than a market.
Why does the NBU persist with this harmful policy?
The NBU needs to announce that it no longer has an exchange-rate target and that it will stop intervening by ending its purchases of dollars on the currency market.
If the NBU lets the exchange rate float, Ukrainians are likely to exchange billions of dollars into hryvnia, driving up the hryvnia exchange rate.
That would contain Ukraine’s inflation, as the NBU could restrict the money supply through high interest rates rather than rationing.
Time is short.
The great economist Rudi Dornbusch used to say that a financial crisis usually starts much later than anyone expects, but then develops faster than anyone can imagine.
Ukraine is on the financial precipice.
Yushchenko and the NBU can still act, but if they do not do so immediately, a costly and unnecessary financial crisis might ensue.
As prime minister, Yushchenko saved his country from financial default in early 2000.
Ukraine’s well-being must not be sacrificed to his political ambitions.
Ukraine’s Orange Christmas
That Ukrainians will vote for their freedom this Christmas season is a coincidence of true perfection.
For our movement is a triumph, not of mobs but of joyous crowds; of protests, not of looting; of clear purpose, not confusion.
As a result, something new will color the habits of those who govern Ukraine from now on: respect for individuals, which is the ultimate check on the abuse of power.
Nothing can ever diminish what was at stake – and the victory that has been won – on the streets of Kyiv.
Ukraine’s people have renewed their self-respect through courage and resolution.
They have reason to be proud.
Self-confidence among the governed and caution among the rulers: these are the psychological springs of democracy and true freedom, and they can never again be diverted in our homeland.
Nobody ever doubted that Ukraine had changed vastly in its twelve years of independence.
Yet, caught in the sights of a gun barrel, nobody – not even the brave men and women who camped in their hundreds of thousands in the snow before Ukraine’s parliament – knew with certainty whether those changes had wrenched Ukrainians from the grip of fear and apathy.
The success of their defiance shows the power of the idea that bewilders outgoing President Leonid Kuchma and his acolytes: that democracy means taking responsibility for one’s fate into one’s own hands.
The regime clearly expected the crowds that protested the fraudulent election of November 21 to scatter in apathy.
They did not.
This left the regime to choose between using force to quell the growing resistance or cutting its losses.
By refusing to leave the streets and squares of Kyiv, Ukraine’s mass volunteer army of democrats forced our country’s gray old men of the past to retreat into the past.
This is a breakthrough that will endure.
For 70 cynical years, and for centuries before that, everything done in the name of Ukrainians was done without our consent.
Corrupt regimes, through intimidation and bribery, insisted on the loyalty of the bureaucracy, police, and armed services.
Newspapers and broadcasts were packed with lies.
The Kuchma regime’s vast wealth, stolen from ordinary Ukrainians, suggested that the reign of thuggery and deceit could go on forever.
But Ukrainians have now given their seal of approval to democracy and an open society.
From now on, the force of ideas, not the force of arms, will win the day.
For once, Karl Marx, the mischievous cause of so much of Ukraine’s misery, got something right: “the point,” he said about the world, “is to change it.”
Of course, our movement was created out of opposition: opposition to corruption, opposition to surrendering our national independence, opposition to the rule of the bully.
The joy of opposition is its simplicity; Ukrainians understood what we opposed and stood side by side with us.
Now we must lead a nation in which – thanks to the cynical ploys and hate-filled rhetoric of a discredited regime – some sections seem to be set against the democracy we seek to build.
But no section of Ukraine is our enemy and none will be treated that way. For we need no reminding of what must be Ukraine’s priority.
We have shouted it from every platform in the country: end corruption and abuse of power for personal and partisan gain.
It is a message carved on our hearts.
Thus, our first task is legal and judicial reform, and here we are given hope by the courage of Ukraine’s Supreme Court, which in overturning the stolen election of November 21 upheld the law and the liberties of Ukrainians against a regime determined to sweep them away.
So we will resist the temptation of revenge and retribution. That way lays demoralization and new divisions.
Ruling in the national interest, rather than for the benefit of favored sections or clans, we will apply the law equally to our supporters and our opponents.
We will be guided, and bound, by the rule of law – and the spirit of ordered liberty that animates it.
Of course, immense difficulties remain.
The first is repairing our country’s unity.
Yes, Ukraine has Ukrainian speakers and it has Russian speakers; yes, it has Orthodox and Catholics.
But those divisions were manipulated with the same sort of cynicism that Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman used to pit Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian against each other in the former Yugoslavia.
Ukrainians recoil, in anger and horror, at the very idea of dividing the nation.
Our nation’s unity is not artificial. We are united as a people and in our shared history of suffering.
Having laid the foundations of genuine democracy, our house will not be divided by anyone.
In renewing our liberties, we will renew our unity. We will renew Ukraine.
Ukraine’s Own Goal
KYIV – Politics and sports are often an incendiary mix, as the controversy now swirling around the Euro 2012 football championship, to be co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland, demonstrates.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, and other European Union leaders have said that they will boycott matches held in Ukraine, owing to the imprisonment of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and other opposition figures.
Why, two decades after communism ended and Ukraine gained its independence, does the country remain mired in economic torpor and an authoritarian politics that has aroused such ire in Europe?
When a country like Ukraine develops slowly and remains poor, it is not because of natural disaster or resource constraints. Bad policies pursued by bad governments are to blame.
Contrary to what many Western economists think, the worst economic breakdowns are not the result of free markets gone haywire, but of excessive concentration of political power.
To insure against the worst human and economic catastrophes, limits to political power must be introduced and a system of checks and balances maintained.
Witness the divergence in long-run economic growth between the Euro 2012 co-hosts.
Poland’s GDP has almost doubled over the last 20 years, while Ukraine is still barely maintaining the output level recorded during the last year of socialism.
Generally speaking, Central and Eastern European countries have performed better economically than the ex-Soviet countries (with the exception of the Baltic states).
Economic growth is a matter not just of quality of life, but of quantity as well.
Child mortality rates have declined in all Central European countries over the past 20 years, especially in Poland, where the rate fell from 17 per 10,000 live births to seven.
In the Czech Republic and Slovenia, life expectancy has increased from 71 to 77, similar to other Central European countries.
